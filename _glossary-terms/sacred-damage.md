Sacred damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the power of sheer Good and carry this holy power over as a form of harmful energy to evil-aligned beings. Attacks that inflict sacred damage inflict an additional 50% damage to evil-aligned opponents or opponents with the Evil subtype.
