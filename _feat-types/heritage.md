Heritage feats represent unlocking the latent potential in your mixed blood, or even differences, deliberate mutations, or divine gifts within creatures of pure blood. These capabilities might appear over time, as the result of exposure to magic that awakens the blood (even on accident) or deliberately, as the creature trains their capabilities. Heritage feats usually require a creature to have one or more creature types or subtypes in order to gain their benefits.
