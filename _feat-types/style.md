For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.

As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you take a swift action to switch styles or the combat encounter ends, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.

**Boar Style:** A tribe of orcs who disdained the use of weapons originally developed this savage unarmed fighting style. They preferred to slaughter their enemies with their bare hands and teeth. Over the centuries, a variety of races have adopted the Boar Style, most notably goblinoids, ogres, and trolls. The objective of the Boar Style is to attack with as much viciousness and cruelty as possible in order to break enemy morale. Fanatical followers of the style use herbal and alchemical reagents to harden their nails and teeth, sometimes performing self-mutilating procedures that result in clawlike nails and sharpened teeth.

**Earth Child Style:** A warrior cadre of dwarves and gnomes dedicated to fighting and slaying giants developed this style. Students of the style learn how to enhance their defensive training to become even more elusive when facing giants.

Eventually, masters of this fighting style learn how to bring down even the mightiest creatures by targeting feet, ankles, and knees.

**Janni Style:** This style, originating humbly from the folk traditions of disparate peoples, represents several similar unarmed fighting arts practiced around the world.

Openly martial versions of this style lose some of the dancelike qualities but retain the style's extraordinary kicking techniques and agility.
