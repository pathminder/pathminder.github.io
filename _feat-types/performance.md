Performance feats are used when you make a [performance combat](/systems/performance-combat/) check, typically granting a special action that occurs when you make that check. Unless you have the [Masterful Display](/feats/masterful-display/) feat, you can only apply the effect of one performance feat to each performance combat check you make.
