An *igniting* weapon functions as a *flaming* weapon that also causes foes to catch fire upon striking a successful critical hit. The target does not get a saving throw to avoid catching fire, but can make a save each round on its turn to put out the fire. The *flaming* ability must be active for the weapon to set enemies on fire.
