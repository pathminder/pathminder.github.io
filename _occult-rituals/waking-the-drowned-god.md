The primary caster begins the ritual by placing the focus in a pool of water that measures at least 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 50 feet deep. After this is done, the secondary casters surround the pool and perform ceremonial chants and wild supplications to the Drowned God, while the primary caster whispers the horrifying truths of the Drowned God into the target's ear. The unspeakable horror and veracity of the whispers create a stronger bond between the target and the Drowned God. The ritual casters then place the target inside the pool.

If the ritual succeeds, the vast and alien mind of the Drowned God overwhelms the target. The Drowned God immediately and hideously transforms the target's body and irrevocably destroys it, replacing the gory remains with the writhing form of the Drowned God, now freed from its prison and unleashed to wreak the destruction it craved so hungrily, and for so long, in its unknown prison. The target is annihilated and can be restored to life only with a [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/) or [*wish*](/spells/wish/) spell.
