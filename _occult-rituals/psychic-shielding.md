The caster must begin this incantation at dusk or dawn, in a windowless room with the intended target (if it is not the caster), surrounded by mithral mirrors pointed inward. As the ritual concludes, the caster blows out a lantern using the diamond dust, leaving her and the target in the darkened room. While in the darkness, the caster must touch the ritual's target before exiting the room. Then, for a number of days equal to the caster's character level, the target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and abilities, but can't use any psychic magic abilities, can't cast psychic spells or use psychic magic, and can't be engaged or engage in a [psychic duel](/systems/psychic-duels/).
