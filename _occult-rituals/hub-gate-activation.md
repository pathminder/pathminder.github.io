backlash: The primary caster is exhausted.
failure: The portal creates a temporary one-way link with a random location, immediately delivering a hostile creature as though via [*summon monster VII*](/spells/summon-monster-vii/). At the GM's discretion, the creature may be accompanied by 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level *summon monster* list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same type from a lower-level list.

By repairing damaged magical runes and realigning the energies based on the gate's planetary position, the caster reactivates a dormant *hub gate*. A reactivated gate automatically reconnects with all its affiliated gates, acting as two-way [*gates*](/spells/gate/) (as per the spell) between the locations. The caster knows the gate's password---which might be anything from an Elven phrase to a song's refrain to a spell---from the research required to learn this ritual. All other creatures who use this gate must also know the password to access the gate's magic after it has been reactivated.
