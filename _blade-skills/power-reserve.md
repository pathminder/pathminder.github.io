The soulknife's innate psychic essence is stronger than others of her kind, growing more powerful as she advances in level. The power point pool granted by the Wild Talent (or Psionic Talent) feat that the soulknife receives at 1st level increases in size by two points per soulknife level (the soulknife does not gain bonus power points for having a high ability score from this ability). If the soulknife possesses a power pool from another source (such as by being 3rd level or higher), this feature adds to that power pool instead. These points may be used to manifest powers (if any are known) and support other abilities that require use of a power point pool. Once selected, the soulknife must rest for 8 hours every day to gain or recover these power points. This blade skill may only be selected once.
