The techniques of the Tempest Gale discipline improve the war soul’s ability to use thrown mind blades or and mind bolts. While he maintains a Tempest Gale stance, the war soul adds his Wisdom modifier on combat maneuver checks and Sleight of Hand checks made using a thrown mind blade or mind bolt.

The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to select this blade skill.
