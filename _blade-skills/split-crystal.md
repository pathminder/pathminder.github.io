You may split off portions of your crystal to perform multiple augmentations on items. When you split your psicrystal in this fashion, small child-crystals are birthed onto a piece of a equipment when using augmentation abilities that fuse to the item, and may be reclaimed by touching the psicrystal to these child-crystals as a free action. When the crystal is split, its overall enhancement bonus is reduced by 1 for each item enhanced. This may be applied to a second weapon if the character wishes to fight with two weapons, or as a prerequisite for other blade skills specifically tailored to the augmented blade's skill set (such as augmenting a shield or a piece of armor).

The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.
