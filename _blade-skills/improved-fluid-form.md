title: improved fluid form
---

When the soulknife uses the Fluid Form blade skill, he may change all of his mind blade's weapon special abilities simultaneously. The mind blade still suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to its enhancement bonus when the Fluid Form blade skill is used. A soulknife must have the Fluid Form blade skill to choose this blade skill.
