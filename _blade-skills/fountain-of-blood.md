With this wrath augment, the brutality blade’s rage blade inflicts bleeding wounds when he activates his psychic strike or upon making a successful critical hit on a target creature. The target suffers 1d4 points of bleed damage for each psychic strike die the brutality blade possesses. This target creature bleeds each round until the wound is bandaged properly (DC 15 Heal check) or until magical healing (such as a *cure* spell) has been applied. The target can be subject to multiple bleeding wounds.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
