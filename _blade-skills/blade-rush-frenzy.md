The soulknife can expend her psionic focus as a full-round action to move up to her speed without provoking attacks of opportunity and make a single melee attack against each creature she is adjacent to at any point in her movement. Each attack is made at her highest base attack bonus with a –2 penalty on the attack roll. The soulknife must possess the Blade Rush blade skill in order to select this blade skill.
