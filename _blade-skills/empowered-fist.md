The soulknife learns to manifest her mind blade as a field of destructive energy as well as the forms her mind blade normally may take. Selection of this blade skill grants the empowered strikes class feature (see soulbolt archetype), and the soulknife gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. The soulknife's empower strikes gain the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind blade, and she may select its own enhancements (such as distance or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind blade. The soulknife may now also take deadly fist specific blade skills. This cannot be taken if you possess the empowered strikes class feature previously.
