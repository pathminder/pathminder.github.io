The brutality blade’s wrath can be infectious, spreading to his allies and inspiring them to acts of rage. While in a raging surge, the brutality blade may expend his psionic focus as a swift action and share his raging euphoria bonuses with allies within 30 feet of his position while his rage blade is manifested. The brutality blade must possess the raging euphoria blade skill to select this wrath augment.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
