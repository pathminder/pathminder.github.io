By using the potential psychic power that resides within her mind blade, the soulknife may carve through the veil between planes and slip gently through it to another location nearby. The soulknife must be wielding her mind blade to use to use this blade skill. As a standard action, the soulknife expends her psionic focus and cuts through the world around her, teleporting as if she had manifested the *fold space* power with a manifester level equal to her soulknife level. Just as with the *fold space* power, the use of this ability ends her turn.

At 16th level, the soulknife can use this ability as a move action.

This blade skill meets the prerequisites for and functions with Dimensional Agility and feats that require it as a prerequisite.

The soulknife must possess the Ghost Step blade skill in order to select this blade skill.
