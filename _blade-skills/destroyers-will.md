While under the benefits of a raging surge, the brutality blade channels his boundless anger to shrug off magics and afflictions alike. The brutality blade may expend his psionic focus to reroll a failed Fortitude or Will saving throw as an immediate action.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
