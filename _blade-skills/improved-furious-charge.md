A soulknife with this ability can expend his psychic strike while making a charge to make an additional attack with his main hand, albeit at a -5 penalty on the attack roll, at the end of a charge action. If the soulknife is wielding two mind blades and has the Twin Strike blade skill, he may instead make an additional attack with each mind blade, but each of these additional attacks suffers a -5 penalty on the attack roll in addition to the penalties for attacking with two weapons. The soulknife does not apply the expended psychic strike's damage to his attacks. The soulknife may only gain the benefit of this blade skill once on any charge. The soulknife must have the Furious Charge blade skill to choose this blade skill.
