The psychic armory gains incredible range from his panoply's attacks. Light weapons increase their range to 100 feet, one-handed weapons increase their range to 60 feet, and two-handed weapons increase their range to 30 feet. If the character possesses the Mind Daggers blade skill, their range increases to 200 feet.

The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.
