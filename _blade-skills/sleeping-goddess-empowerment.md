By increasing his internal psionic potency within through mastery of the Sleeping Goddess discipline, the war soul is able to infuse great psionic power and understanding within his mind blade. While he maintains a Sleeping Goddess stance, he can charge his mind blade with psionic energy as a move action. He can release this energy as a free action when he hits with a strike to deal an additional 1d8 points of damage. This additional damage increases to 2d8 at 12th level and to 3d8 at 18th level, and counts as psychic strike for the purposes of meeting prerequisites and for blade skills and other abilities that require psychic strike.

The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to select this blade skill.
