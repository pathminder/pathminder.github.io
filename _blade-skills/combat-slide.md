Upon successfully striking an enemy in melee, the soulknife may immediately make a 5-foot step (even if she's already moved in the round, but not if she's taken a 5-foot step). In addition, when someone misses the soulknife with a melee attack, he may spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step.
