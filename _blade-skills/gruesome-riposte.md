The soulknife may expend his psionic focus as an immediate action to attack an enemy who has successfully struck his in melee. This attack is assumed to happen after the successful attack, so he cannot use this ability if the attack would put his below 0 hit points, nor does dropping his enemy below 0 hit points prevent the attack from hitting.
