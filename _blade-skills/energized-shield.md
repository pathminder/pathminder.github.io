As an immediate action when the soulknife is attacked in melee and by expending his psionic focus, he may charge his mind shield with one of the energy types he could normally make his mind blade deal, dealing additional points of the appropriate type of energy damage equal to his normal psychic strike damage to his attacker. This effect lasts only for one attack. The soulknife must have the mind shield blade skill and one of the fire blade, ice blade, lightning blade, or thunder blade blade skills to choose this blade skill.
