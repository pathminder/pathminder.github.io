While under the benefits of a raging surge, the brutality blade with this wrath augment may unleash furious blows upon his target. When attacking a foe and unleashing his psychic strike ability upon them, he may expend his psionic focus to make a second attack at the same attack bonus upon the target.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
