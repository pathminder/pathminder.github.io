The soulknife with this blade skill may channel her psionic energies into a long, thin mind whip of mental strength that is capable of both flaying body and mind. The whip functions in all respects as whip or scorpion whip (chosen when manifesting a mind blade using this blade skill). While in this form, the soulknife is considered to be proficient with both weapons. Mindflayer is compatible with the Whip Mastery feat (and subsequent feats). The soulknife may expend her psionic focus when making an attack using her psychic strike to cause intense levels of pain with her mind whip. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 soulknife level + Wisdom modifier) or become dazed for one round.
