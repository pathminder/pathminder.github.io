While manifesting a rage blade, the brutality blade with this wrath augment subsumes his rage blade as a swift action and grows in size as if he had used the *expansion* psionic power (using his class level as his manifester level to determine its effects). While in this form, his hands radiate raging psychic energy in the form of crude claws or knives. These claws are treated as light weapon forms of his mind blade except that they count as both natural and manufactured weapons. Bloody ectoplasm also forms blades on his body, which count as armor spikes. The rage blade takes a --1 to its overall enhancement bonus while manifested this way, but his both of his rage blades and his armor spikes share the same enhancement bonuses and weapon properties. This infusion of wrathful power is maintained as long as the rage blade is manifested.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
