By attaching his psicrystal to a tool or item when making a Craft or Profession skill check, or when using an item to aid in Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim checks, the augmented blade gains a competence bonus on these checks equal to his mind blade enhancement bonus.

The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.
