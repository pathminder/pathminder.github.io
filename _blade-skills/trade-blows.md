When the soulknife uses the total defense action, he may make a melee attack at his normal attack bonus on anyone that makes a melee attack against her, regardless of whether the opponent's attack hits. This attack is resolved immediately after the opponent's attack. The soulknife may make one such attack for each attack made against her. If multiple opponents attack he soulknife, each attack he makes must be against the enemy that triggered it. All such attacks are made with a -4 penalty on the attack roll, and are an exception to the rule that you cannot attack during the total defense action.
