The soulknife can form his mind bolt to replicate any single ranged weapon (except firearms), chosen at the time he takes this blade skill. The soulknife is proficient with his mind bolt in this form and it functions in all ways as the chosen weapon. This blade skill may be taken multiple times; each time, it allows the soulknife to form his mind bolt to replicate a different ranged weapon (except firearms). The soulknife must have the ability to form a mind bolt to select this blade skill.
