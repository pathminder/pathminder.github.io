As a full-round action, a soulknife can make one melee attack against each enemy adjacent to her. If he hits, the attack deals no damage, but each enemy hit takes a -5 penalty to all melee and ranged damage rolls until the start of the soulknife's next turn. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.
