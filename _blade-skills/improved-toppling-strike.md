If the soulknife's mind blade has the Trip special feature, he may use it to make a single attack at his full base attack bonus as a standard action. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the soulknife can make a free trip attack (using his full base attack bonus) against the same foe. If he successfully trips that foe, he may make an additional trip attack (using his full base attack bonus) against another foe within reach and adjacent to the first foe. As long as he successfully trips his foe, he may continue to make trip attempts against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are within his reach. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity for these trip attempts. A soulknife must have the Toppling Strike and Weapon Special blade skills before selecting this blade skill.
