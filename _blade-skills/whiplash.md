The soulknife can throw his mind shield as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10. In addition, by expending psionic focus as a free action after making a ranged attack with his mind shield, the soulknife can cause the shield to return back to his hand, hitting any enemy in line of effect from his target and dealing damage as a light shield. Soulknives with the Form Mind Shield class feature instead deal damage as a heavy shield. The soulknife makes a ranged attack roll for each enemy in the line of effect. The soulknife may not use this blade skill if his mind shield is in the form of a tower shield. The soulknife must have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.
