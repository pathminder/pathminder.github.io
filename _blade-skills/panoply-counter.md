With lightning reaction time, the psychic armory is capable of bringing her panoply of blades into positions to defend her from attacks. As an immediate action, the psychic armory may expend her psionic focus to oppose her opponent's attack roll against her with panoply of blades. She makes an attack roll at her full base attack bonus to do to this as if she were making an attack with the panoply, and if the result is equal to or higher than the attacker's result, the attack is negated by the panoply blocking the attack. This can be used on melee or ranged attacks, and/or spells and powers with touch or ranged attacks equally.

The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.
