As a move action, the psychic armory may gather one of her mind blades from the panoply and briefly focus it into a more traditional mind blade (if the psychic armory possesses the Quick Draw feat or the Swift Panoply class feature, she may gather a weapon as a swift action instead if she chooses). The psychic armory may grab a single light, one-handed or two-handed weapon, or a pair of light weapons; this weapon gains the benefits of the enhanced armory class feature and may be used in melee combat (the psychic armory may retain her ability to add her Wisdom modifier to attack and damage rolls, or may use her Strength score if she prefers to). A weapon gathered by this ability may be used with feats or special abilities that may be used with melee weapons of that type. This weapon stays manifest for 1 + the psychic armory's Wisdom modifier rounds (minimum of 2 rounds). If the character possesses the Mind Daggers blade skill, a pair of mind daggers may be distilled from her panoply for use in melee. If the psychic armory possesses a *crystal hilt*, she may use her distilled panoply with this item (*crystal iouns* will continue to lend their bonus to distilled weapons but cannot be combined with other *crystalline focus* items).

The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.
