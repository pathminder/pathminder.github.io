The war soul’s mind blade is infused with the light and fire that is the hallmark of the Solar Wind discipline. Whenever using the mind blade as a ranged weapon in a Solar Wind stance, the mind blade gains the *flaming* weapon property, and increases its range increment by +10 ft. Finally, the war soul may use his mind blade to generate light as a torch when manifested.

The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.
