The psychic armory is capable of directing her panoply of blades while wielding a member of it in melee combat. When making a full attack, she may expend her psionic focus and make the same number of ranged attacks with her panoply as she does with her mind blade in melee combat (Example, if the psychic armory possesses a base attack bonus of +12, she can make up to three attacks with her mind blade in melee and up to three ranged attacks with her panoply of blades). All attacks made this round suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls due to her divided focus. This blade skill takes a lot out of the mental faculties of the psychic armory, and she may only utilize this blade skill a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). If used with the Improved Psychic Strike feat, the psychic armory must decide if it will affect the ranged attacks or the melee attacks made with her mind blade (never both).

The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature and possess the Distill Panoply armory tactic to select this armory tactic.
