The soulknife learns to manifest her mind blade as a variety of ranged weapons as well as the forms her mind blade normally may take. Selection of this blade skill grants the form mind bolt and launch mind bolt class features (see soulbolt archetype). The soulknife is always considered proficient with her mind bolt. The mind bolt gains the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind blade and may select its own enhancements (such as distance or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind blade.

This blade skill cannot be taken if you already possess the form mind bolt class feature.
