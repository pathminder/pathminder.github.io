The soulknife may charge her mind blade (or equivalent ability) with explosive psychokinetic energies. As a standard action, the soulknife uses her throw mind blade class feature (or equivalent ability) against a target creature. This attack must be charged by her psychic strike class feature. Upon successfully hitting the target, the attack explodes with psychokinetic power as if it were a splash weapon against targets within a 10-foot-radius zone from the targeted creature. The splash damage is equal to her psychic strike damage plus her mind blade enhancement bonus per psychic strike die. The soulknife may apply the following blade skills to her psychokinetic grenades: Fire Blade, Ice Blade, Lightning Blade, or Thunder Blade.
