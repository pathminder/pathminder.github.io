When utilizing multiple mind blades, the soulknife may charge both blades with his psychic strike ability at the same time (including when expending his focus to charge his psychic strike). However, his psychic strike damage is reduced by 1d8 when using this option. Damage remains normal when each weapon is charged separately.
