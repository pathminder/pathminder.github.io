As a full round action, a psychic armory expends her psionic focus and spreads out her panoply of blades in a wide radius of bladed shards around herself (10 feet + 5 feet per four psychic armory levels), quivering with aggressive intent, ready to attack. Creatures that walk in this area treat it as difficult terrain, and the psychic armory may make attacks of opportunity as if she threatened every square in the burst. While in effect, she may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to her Wisdom modifier. This uses all of her blades for the round and her panoply is refreshed the following round, ending this effect. If the psychic armory possessed an energy-based blade skill (such as Fire Blade), she may choose to deal half of the damage from attacks of opportunity made with this skill as energy damage of the same type as the energy based blade skill of her choice.

The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.
