The war soul is capable of such fine manipulations of time that he seems prophetic. While he maintains a Riven Hourglass stance, the war soul can use his Wisdom modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier for Reflex saves and initiative checks.

The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to select this blade skill.
