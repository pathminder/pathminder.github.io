The fluid and deadly dance of the Thrashing Dragon war soul brings a level of graceful savagery to battle. While in a Thrashing Dragon stance and using his mind blade as two separate weapons to two-weapon fight, the war soul gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls. This bonus improves at 5th level to +2, and increases by an additional +1 every five war soul levels.

The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.
