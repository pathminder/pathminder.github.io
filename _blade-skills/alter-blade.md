The soulknife gains the ability to shape his mind blade into different weapon forms. She may change his blade's form to the light weapon, one-handed weapon, or two-handed weapon forms any time he forms his mind blade. Additionally, the soulknife may choose to form his mind blade into a one-handed weapon and a light weapon instead of two light weapons.
