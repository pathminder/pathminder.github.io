By attaching his psicrystal to a headband or eye-slot item the augmented blade gains a competence bonus equal to his mind blade’s enhancement bonus on any Appraise, Autohypnosis, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive or Spellcraft skill checks.

The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.
