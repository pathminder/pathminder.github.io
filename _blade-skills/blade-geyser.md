While manifesting a rage blade, the brutality blade may expend his psionic focus as a full round action and drive his blade into the ground at his feet, causing the blade to split beneath him and erupt into circle of blades around him. This blade skill functions as per the Whirlwind Attack feat.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
