The soulknife may form one or a pair of mind daggers in place of his normal forms. Mind daggers have a range increment of 30 ft when thrown, deal 1d4 points of damage (type assigned in the same manner as other forms) and have a critical range of 19- 20/x2. She may switch between mind daggers and his chosen blade form at will as a free action, including in the middle of full attacks, and it can be done more than once per round (this is an exception to the full-round action normally required to shape a mind blade). She cannot switch between the daggers and the two-handed mind blade form unless only forming a single dagger. Mind daggers have the same enhancement configuration as the soulknife's current mind blade configuration.
