When using the total defense action or attacking defensively, as a free action on his turn the soulknife can transform his mind shield into a tower shield until the start of his next turn. All of the standard penalties for having a mind shield shaped as a tower shield apply. The soulknife must have the Mind Shield blade skill to choose this blade skill.
