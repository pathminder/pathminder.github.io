The psychic potential within the soulknife opens up telepathic pathways in her mind, allowing her to reach out and connect to the minds of others. She gains telepathy out to a range of 200 feet and can communicate with any creature, regardless of language, so long as they have an Intelligence of 1 or higher. The range of her telepathy increases by 10 feet for every two soulknife levels after. Additionally, as long as she maintains psionic focus, she can detect other creatures within 30 feet using telepathy to communicate, although she cannot determine the content of the communication.
