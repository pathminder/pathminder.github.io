When the soulknife feints in combat, he may also form his mind blade in the same action as the feint. Additionally, Bluff is now a class skill for the soulknife. If the soulknife has the Improved Feint feat and the psychic strike class feature, once per round he may also charge his psychic strike when performing a feint and forming his mind blade in the same action. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.
