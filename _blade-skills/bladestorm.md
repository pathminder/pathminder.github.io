As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, the soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead throw one mind blade at his full attack bonus at all opponents within 30 feet, ignoring the normal range increments for throwing a mind blade. Regardless of the number of attacks he makes, he only provokes attacks of opportunity as though he made a single ranged attack.

The soulknife must possess the Bladewind blade skill to take this ability, and this ability may not be used if the mind blade is in a two-handed weapon form.
