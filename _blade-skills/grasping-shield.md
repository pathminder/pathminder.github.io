The soulknife's mind shield takes on an adhesive quality. Once per round, he may make a free disarm attempt against any enemy that makes a melee attack that misses her. This disarm attempt counts as an attack of opportunity and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The soulknife must have the shield block blade skill and the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.
