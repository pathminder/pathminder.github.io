title: caltrop spray
---

The soulknife is capable of shattering and scattering her mind blade into dozens of tiny pieces to lay down caltrops over an area as a standard action. The soulknife must be wielding her mind blade to use this blade skill, and she destroys it to create this effect (she can re-manifest it as normal). For each die of psychic strike damage she has (minimum of 1), the soulknife lays down a 5-foot area of caltrops within 30 feet of her. Unlike normal caltrops, these psychically-created traps harbor the soulknife's will within them, and gain a bonus on their attack rolls equal to her Wisdom modifier. In addition, they can tell friend from foe, and never attack or damage the soulknife's allies. These caltrops count as magic weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, and exist for a number of rounds equal to the soulknife's class level.
