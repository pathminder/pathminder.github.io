By channeling disruptive psionic energies through her mind blade, the soulknife may stun her foes with her psychic strike. When attacking a foe with her mind blade, she may expend her psychic strike and her psionic focus to stun her target. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the soulknife's class level + the soulknife's Wisdom modifier) or become stunned for 1 round (until just before your next turn).

This blade skill also counts as the Stunning Fist feat for the purposes of fulfilling prerequisites or for effects and abilities that modify or use the feat.
