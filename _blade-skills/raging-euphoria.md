The brutality blade is capable of churning forth great anger and turmoil when his rage blade has manifested. While his rage blade is manifested, the brutality blade's innate psionic energies empower his physical form with surging forces. This surge of rage and anger provides a +1 morale bonus to his attack and damage rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 14th level and again at 20th level. These bonuses persist while the rage blade is manifested and end when the rage blade is dismissed.

The soulknife must have the manifest rage blade class feature to select this blade skill.
