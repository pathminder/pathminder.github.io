The rogue can use her rogue talents more often. Once per day, she can use a rogue talent that is normally only usable once per day one additional time. At 10th level and 18th level, she can use this talent one additional time per day (for a maximum total of 3 additional uses of a rogue talent that can normally only be used once per day). The uses of this talent do not have to be spent on the same rogue talent. This ability cannot be used with an advanced talent.
