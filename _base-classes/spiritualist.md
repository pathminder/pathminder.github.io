      A spiritualist casts psychic spells drawn from the spiritualist spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spiritualist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist's Wisdom modifier.

      A spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Spiritualist. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1--3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).

      A spiritualist's selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist's choice. At each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The numbers on the table are fixed.

      Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast. A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

      A spiritualist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table: The Spiritualist under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.

  - name: phantom

      A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the [shared consciousness](#shared-consciousness) class feature), manifest it partially (see the [bonded manifestation](#bonded-manifestation) class feature), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score.

      A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.

      While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of *dispel magic*, but spells such as *dismissal* and *banishment* work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche.

      Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.

      Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a [bonded manifestation](#bonded-manifestation)) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.

      A phantom was once a sentient, living creature that experienced great turmoil in life or during death. The power of its emotional trauma ripped it from the flow of spirits rushing toward the Astral Plane and the fates beyond, pulling it through the Ethereal Plane and toward the Negative Energy Plane. During the decent to nothingness and undeath, the spirit was able to break free, and made its way back to the Material Plane to find shelter within the consciousness of a powerful psychic spellcaster. That fusion created a spiritualist.

      Phantoms may retain some of their memories from life, but not many. Some phantoms wish to unburden themselves of their emotional shackles, while others just wish to continue existing while avoiding the corruption of undeath. Others still wish nothing more than to inflict their torment upon the living---taking their revenge on life for the horrors they faced during and after death.

      Phantoms are powerful beings, but they are far more emotional than they are rational. Phantoms are still shackled by the emotions that created them, and spiritualists must maintain strong control over their phantoms to keep the phantom's often-violent emotions in check.

      **Phantom Statistics By Level:** A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels. The following table determines many of the base statistics of the phantom. Each phantom possesses an emotional focus that modifies these base statistics and abilities. Phantoms are considered outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.

      *Class Level:* This is the spiritualist's class level.

      *HD:* This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the phantom possesses, each of which is modified by the phantom's Constitution, as normal.

      *BAB:* This is the phantom's base attack bonus. A phantom's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Phantoms do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons at higher base attack bonuses.

      *Good/Bad Saves:* These are the phantom's base saving throw bonuses. A phantom possesses two good saving throws and one bad saving throw, determined by the phantom's emotional focus.

      *Skills:* This lists the phantom's total skill ranks. A phantom can assign skill ranks to any skills, but it must possess the appropriate appendage to use some skills. Phantoms with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (a phantom gains a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die). A phantom can't have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Phantom skill ranks are set once chosen.

      *Feats:* This is the total number of feats possessed by a phantom. A phantom can select any feat it qualifies for, but it must possess the appropriate appendage in order to use some feats. Phantom feats are set once chosen.

      *Armor Bonus:* The number noted here is the increase to the phantom's natural armor bonus when it manifests as an ectoplasmic creature, and its deflection bonus when it manifests as an incorporeal creature. An ectoplasmic or incorporeal manifested phantom can't wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the spiritualist's connection with the phantom; a phantom may seem to be wearing armor, but this appearance is just an illusory part of its appearance.

      *Dex/Cha Bonus:* Add this bonus to the phantom's Dexterity and Charisma scores.

      *Slam:* Phantoms have two slam natural weapon attacks. Those attacks' damage is based on the size of the phantom and is sometimes modified by the abilities of the phantom's emotional focus. The primary table gives the damage by spiritualist level of the slam attacks made by a Medium phantom. See the secondary table for the damage of such attacks for Small and Large phantoms. Often, an individual phantom manifests in a form that makes it appear as if it had weapons or other natural attacks. Regardless of their apparent forms, the phantom's attacks still deal the slam attack damage listed.

      *Special:* This column includes a number of abilities gained by all phantoms as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.

      - *Darkvision (Ex):* The phantom has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
      - *Link (Su):* A spiritualist and her phantom share a mental link that allows for communication across distances (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action that can be performed even when it isn't the spiritualist's turn, but the spiritualist and the phantom must both be conscious to communicate in this way. This allows the spiritualist to give orders to her phantom at any time. Magic items interfere with a spiritualist's connection to her phantom; as a result, the spiritualist and her phantom share magic item slots. For example, if the spiritualist is wearing a magic ring, her phantom can wear only one magic ring. In the case of a conflict, the items worn by the spiritualist remain active, and those worn by the phantom become dormant. The phantom must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.
      - *Share Spells (Su):* The spiritualist can cast a spell with a target of "you" on her phantom (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A spiritualist can cast spells from the spiritualist spell list on her phantom even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the phantom's type (outsider). This ability does not allow the phantom to share abilities that aren't spells, even if they function like spells.
      - *Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action. If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can't hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost. If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom's melee reach at the time.
      - *Magic Attacks (Su):* When the phantom manifests in ectoplasmic form, it treats its slam attacks as if they were magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the spiritualist is 10th level or higher, all of the phantom's weapons are treated as the alignment of the phantom for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
      - *Ability Score Increase (Ex):* The phantom adds 1 to one of its ability scores.
      - *Devotion (Ex):* The phantom gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.
      - *Incorporeal Flight (Su):* When the phantom manifests in incorporeal form, it has a fly speed of 40 feet (good).

      **Size and Appearance:** A spiritualist's phantom is typically the same size as the spiritualist. A spiritualist can have a phantom that is one size category smaller than her, and if she is Small or smaller, she can have a phantom one size category larger than her. A phantom is always a humanoid-shaped creature, and looks somewhat like it did in its past life while manifested, though the emotional turmoil of its existence usually warps its appearance in some way.

      **Base Statistics:** Every phantom has the following base statistics, which are then modified by its size and emotional focus.

      **Phantom**
      **Starting Statistics:** **Type** Outsider (phantom); **Size** As spiritualist or one size category smaller (or one size category larger, if the spiritualist is Small or smaller); **Speed** 30 ft.; **AC** +2 dodge (in incorporeal form) or +2 natural armor (in ectoplasmic form); **Attack** 2 slams (1d6 or 1d4 if size Small); **Ability Scores** Str 12, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 13.

      **Phantom Skills:** The following skills are class skills for the phantom: Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, the spiritualist can choose one additional skill as a class skill for her phantom. The phantom also gains two class skills based on its emotional focus. The phantom automatically gains bonus ranks in these two skills as the spiritualist increases in level---its number of ranks in these skills is always equal to its number of Hit Dice.

      **Full Manifestation Forms:** Each time she fully manifests her phantom, the spiritualist must choose whether to manifest the phantom in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. The phantom gains the statistics presented on the table, modified by the phantom's emotional focus and by the type of manifestation the spiritualist chooses.

      *Ectoplasmic:* When the spiritualist manifests her phantom in ectoplasmic form, the phantom gains the following abilities.

      - *Damage Reduction:* A phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form has DR 5/slashing. When the spiritualist reaches 5th level, the phantom gains DR 5/magic. At 10th level, the damage resistance increases to 10/magic. At 15th level, it increases to 15/magic, and at 20th level, the damage reduction becomes DR 15/---.
      - *Phase Lurch (Su):* A phantom in ectoplasmic form has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, it must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An ectoplasmic phantom can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.

      *Incorporeal:* When the spiritualist chooses to manifest the phantom in incorporeal form, the phantom appears within 30 feet of the spiritualist as a ghostly apparition. It gains the incorporeal subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301), including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier. Since it isn't an undead creature, it takes no damage from holy water or positive energy. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, an incorporeal phantom can't attack corporeal creatures, except to deliver touch-attack spells using the deliver touch spell ability. An incorporeal manifested phantom can make slam attacks against other incorporeal creatures as if it were in ectoplasmic form.

      **Emotional Focus:** Each phantom has an emotional focus---a powerful emotion based on some experience in life that keeps it tethered to the Material and Ethereal planes. This emotional focus also grants the phantom abilities that it can use while manifested. The type of each ability and its power are determined by the spiritualist's level.

      The emotional focus determines which bonus skill ranks the phantom gains, as well as the skills in which its spiritualist master gains Skill Focus. It also determines the good saving throws of the manifested phantom and the special abilities the phantom gains as it increases in level.

      While phantoms tend to appear much as they did in life---at least as they did at the time of death---each emotional focus twists a phantom's visage, mannerisms, and even personality in its own way. Unlike with most creatures, a phantom's emotion aura often manifests for all to see, even those without the benefit of spells or abilities. Often phantoms manifest these emotion auras in unique ways, some of which are described in individual emotional focus descriptions.

      **Anger:** Phantoms with this emotional focus are filled with seething anger from events in their past lives. Phantoms with this focus often take the form of hulking brutes with furrowed brows or of frenzied creatures that always seem ready to strike down those who come too near. Many times, these phantoms exude a bright red aura, especially when they are engaged in combat, or they seem to breathe a red mist in shallow pants from behind clenched, phantasmal teeth.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Fortitude and Will.

      *Strength Focus:* The phantom gains a +2 bonus to Strength and a --2 penalty to Dexterity. Instead of the phantom gaining a bonus to Dexterity as the spiritualist gains levels, an anger-focused phantom gains a bonus to Strength instead.

      *Powerful Strike (Ex):* A phantom with this focus deals more damage with its slam attacks. It deals slam damage as a creature one size category larger than its current size. The phantom also gains Power Attack as a bonus feat.

      *Aura of Fury (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura of fury. Creatures within the aura gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls but take a --2 penalty to AC. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Ferocious Mien (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a phantom in ectoplasmic form can grow more ferocious and frightening. It becomes one size category larger than its current size, as affected by an *enlarge person* spell, and grows fiercer in combat, as if affected by a *rage* spell. This effect lasts for 1 round per class level of the spiritualist. When the spiritualist reaches 18th level, a phantom using ferocious mien also gains the frightful presence extraordinary ability (Bestiary 300; range 30 feet, duration 5d6 rounds).

      *Furious Wail (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can emit a single angry wail that acts as *wail of the banshee*. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC of the effect is 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      **Dedication:** Either through a sense of love or the desire to finish some unfinished task, a phantom with this emotional focus has an undying devotion to something or someone in the world. It's often the case that a phantom with this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.

      *Skill:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Sense Motive equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Reflex and Will.

      *Iron Will:* The phantom gains Iron Will as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is within its master's consciousness, it grants the benefits of Iron Will to its master if its master doesn't have that feat.

      *Dutiful Strike (Su):* When a creature makes an attack against the phantom's master, the phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that target, and deals damage against that target as if the phantom were one size category larger. For the purposes of this ability, an attack includes any harmful spell targeting the spiritualist master of whose area or effect includes the spiritualist master. Dutiful strike lasts for 1 minute, until another creature attacks the phantom's spiritualist master (at which point this effect transfers to the new attacker), or until the attacking creature is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, whichever occurs first.

      *Defending Aura (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that grants protection to nearby allies. It can activate this aura at will as a swift action. Allies within the aura gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to CMD and on all saving throws. Deactivating the aura is a free action.

      *Devoted Servant (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level and is caught unawares by an attack (such as an attack made in a surprise round or while the spiritualist is asleep or an attack by a creature using Stealth), if the phantom is not fully manifested, it automatically fully manifests from the spiritualist's consciousness to protect its master. The phantom stays manifested as long as the spiritualist is unaware and in danger. This ability requires no action from the spiritualist.

      *Steadfast Devotion (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom becomes immune to detrimental mind-affecting effects and all forms of possession, such as *magic jar* and *possession*. Furthermore, the phantom is immune to *banishment*, *dismissal*, and similar effects.

      **Despair:** Some creatures die in such horrific ways, or live such pointless and senseless lives, that despair grips their very beings. Phantoms with this focus use misery as a weapon, inflicting the living with the gloom of the phantoms' continued existence. Despair phantoms often appear twisted or wounded, showing the grisly circumstances of their demise. Their coloration tends to have a grayish or sickly green cast. When they speak, they do so in terrifying whispers or high-pitched screeches.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Fortitude and Will.

      *Power from Despair:* The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures that are shaken, frightened, panicked, cowering, or subject to effects such as aura of despair or *crushing despair*. Miserable Strike (Su): If the phantom hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or take a --2 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round. This is a mind- affecting fear and emotionUM effect. Penalties from multiple hits don't stack with themselves.

      *Aura of Despair (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 10-foot aura of despair. Enemies within the aura take a --2 penalty on all saving throws. This is a fear effect. Deactivating the aura is a free action.

      *Despairing Shout (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, three times per day as a standard action, the phantom can emit a shout that acts as *crushing despair*. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC of the effect equals 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Inescapable Despair (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, if the phantom hits with its slam attack, the creature hit doesn't get a save to resist the effects of miserable strike.

      **Fear:** A phantom with this emotional focus suffered from overwhelming fear in life. As a phantom, it is able to channel that fear into a terrifying weapon. Fear phantoms are often horrifying to behold. Sometimes they appear as ghostly figures in tattered funeral garb or wrapped in chains or other bindings. Their features may be distorted into gaunt and haunting forms, making them seem more like ghosts or spectres. A miasma of livid gray swirling motes often surrounds their forms as they stalk their surroundings, seeking to bestow their terror on others.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, such a phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Reflex and Will.

      *Stealthy:* The phantom gains Stealthy as a bonus feat.

      *Horrifying Strike (Ex):* If the phantom hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Multiple attacks against the same creature do not cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

      *Increase Fear (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot- radius aura that amplifies the fear conditions of enemies within it if they fail their Will saving throws (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). A shaken enemy in the aura becomes frightened, a frightened creature becomes panicked, and a panicked creature cowers. This effect lasts either as long as the enemy stays within the aura and is under the condition of the initial fear effect, or for a number of rounds after it leaves the aura equal to 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice, or until the end of the original fear effect's duration, whichever comes first. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to this effect from the same phantom for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Frightful Attack (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, if the phantom hits with a slam attack, it can frighten those it hits instead of causing them to be shaken (the phantom chooses when it makes the attack). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

      *Shelter Allies (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom protects its allies from terror. Allies within the phantom's increase fear aura are immune to fear as long as they are within the aura. This ability also grants the phantom's spiritualist master immunity to fear as long as the phantom is not banished to the Ethereal Plane.

      **Hatred:** Few things draw a spirit toward the Negative Material Plane like the emotion of hatred. Phantoms with this focus often are blinded by---and blind others with---this powerful emotion. These phantoms are frequently darker and more foreboding than all but those phantoms with the fear emotional focus. Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt figures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Fortitude and Ref lex.

      *Weapon Finesse:* The phantom gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.

      *Hated Target (Su):* The phantom can take a move action to designate one creature within its line of sight as a hated target. The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against its hated target, and a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice (minimum 1). The phantom is so focused on this hated target that it takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls against all other creatures. The phantom can maintain these bonuses against only one target at a time, and these bonuses remain in effect until either the hated opponent is dead or it has been out of the phantom's line of sight for at least 1 minute. When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can use this ability as a swift action, and takes no penalty when attacking creatures that are not designated as its hated enemy. The phantom must be manifested in ectoplasmic form to use this ability (unless the spiritualist is 17th level or higher; see Shared Hatred below).

      *Hateful Aura (Su)*: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that inflicts pain upon the minds of those who dare damage it or its master. Enemies within the aura that deal damage to the spiritualist or the phantom take an amount of damage equal to the phantom's Charisma bonus. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Sneak Attack (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom gains sneak attack +3d6, but only against its hated enemy. At 18th level, the sneak attack damage increases to +5d6.

      *Shared Hatred (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom can grant its hatred to others. When the phantom designates a hated enemy, its allies also gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls against that enemy. Furthermore, the phantom can use its hated target ability even when in incorporeal form; when it does, it can make slam attacks against a corporeal creature, but only if that corporeal creature is its hated target.

      **Jealousy:** A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything---its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Appraise and Bluff equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Reflex and Will.

      *Deceitful:* The phantom gains Deceitful as a bonus feat.

      *Jealous Combatant (Su):* Each time the phantom hits a creature with a melee attack, for 1 round that creature takes a --2 penalty on all attack rolls made against anyone other than the phantom. This effect does not stack with itself.

      *Resentful Aura (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot- radius aura that forces enemies within the aura who make an attack or cast a spell that does not include the phantom in its effect to succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or become staggered until the end of the enemy's next turn. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Retribution (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, each time a creature attacks the phantom's master, whether that attack hits or misses, it enrages the phantom. Until the end of the phantom's next turn, any attack the phantom makes that hits the creature that has attacked her deals 2d8 extra points of damage. This extra damage is precision damage.

      *Mine to Take (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as an immediate action, just before the phantom's master is about to attempt a saving throw or be targeted by an attack roll, the phantom and the spiritualist can swap places as long as both are on the same plane and the phantom is aware of the attack or effect. After the swap occurs, the phantom is targeted by the attack or effect that triggered this ability, though the phantom may be immune or resistant to the effect. This is a teleportation effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      **Zeal:** A phantom with this emotional focus fixates on every task given as if it were the phantom's last. The most basic commands are treated as life-and-death situations, and the truly dangerous ones are faced with a resolve and tenacity that sometimes defies common sense. Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.

      *Skills:* The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

      *Good Saves:* Fortitude and Reflex.

      *Tracking:* The phantom adds half its number of Hit Dice (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks to follow tracks.

      *Ruthless Combatant (Su):* The phantom threatens a critical hit with its slam attacks on a roll of 19--20. When the spiritualist reaches 11th level, the phantom's critical modifier with slam attacks increases to ×3. This doesn't stack with Improved Critical or similar effects.

      *Determination Aura (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot- radius aura that grants its zeal to nearby allies. Allies within the aura gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and saving throws. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

      *Steadfast Servant (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can stay manifested even when its spiritualist master is unconscious or asleep.

      *Zeal's Resolve (Su):* When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, three times per day as a free action, when the phantom misses with an attack roll or fails a saving throw, it can reroll the failed attack or saving throw. It must take the new result, even if that result is worse.

      12: +8 saves
    text: At 1st level, while a phantom is confined in a spiritualist's consciousness (but not while it's fully manifested or banished to the Ethereal Plane), it grants the spiritualist the Skill Focus feat in two skills determined by the phantom's emotional focus, unless the spiritualist already has Skill Focus in those skills. It also grants a +4 bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Lastly, once per day, when the spiritualist fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, as an immediate action she can shunt that effect into the phantom's section of her consciousness instead. When she does so, she is not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, the spiritualist loses the bonuses on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and the Skill Focus effects granted by her phantom, and can't use this ability to shunt a mind-affecting effect into the phantom's consciousness or manifest her phantom in any way. When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the phantom's consciousness, spells such as *dispel magic* and *break enchantment* can be cast on the spiritualist to end the effect's duration as if the spiritualist were affected by the mind-affecting effect.

  - name: etheric tether
    type: Su
    levels: [1]
    text: |
      At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane.

      This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within 50 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than 50 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master.

      If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours.

  - name: bonded senses
    type: Su
    levels: [2]
    text: At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling everything her phantom does. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive. There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this effect as a free action.

  - name: bonded manifestation
    type: Su
    levels: [3, 8, 13, 18]
    levels_text:
      8: ectoplasmic tendrils, incorporeal *ghost touch*
      13: ectoplasmic armor, incorporeal *invisibility*
      18: ectoplasmic tendril whirlwind, incorporeal subtype
    text: |
      At 3rd level, as a swift action, a spiritualist can pull on the consciousness of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness. For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the spiritualist's consciousness; it can't be manifested in any other way.

      During a bonded manifestation, the phantom can't be damaged, dismissed, or banished. A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round of use.

      When a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.

      *Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation:* When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

      At 8th level, the spiritualist also sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either a swift or a standard action (spiritualist's choice), the spiritualist can use one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with one hand.

      At 13th level, the phantom's ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction in speed.

      At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit are considered normal hits rather than critical threats.

      *Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation:* When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks.

      At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the *ghost touch* magic weapon special ability.

      At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the *invisibility* spell) until the start of her next turn.

      At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation.

    text: At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind- affecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.

      At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her consciousness. This ability functions as *dimension door*, using the spiritualist's class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are occupied).

      When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded manifestation.

      The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond 6th.

For the spiritualist, these bonuses increase to +4. The spiritualist and allies within range don't gain this bonus if the manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. While the phantom is incorporeally manifested, allies within 30 feet of the phantom receive a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. For the spiritualist, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn't apply if the phantom is unconscious.

As long as the phantom has 1 or more hit points, when the spiritualist takes damage that would reduce her to fewer than 0 hit points, those points of damage are transferred to the phantom instead. This transfer stops after the phantom takes all the points of damage or the phantom is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to its Constitution score. In the latter case, points of damage dealt in excess of this limit are dealt to the spiritualist. This ability affects only effects that deal hit point damage.

---

Becoming a spiritualist is not a calling---it's a phenomenon. When a creature dies, its spirit flees its body and begins the next stage of its existence. Debilitating emotional attachments during life and other psychic corruptions cause some spirits to drift into the Ethereal Plane and descend toward the Negative Energy Plane. Some of these spirits are able to escape the pull of undeath and make their way back to the Material Plane, seeking refuge in a psychically attuned mind. Such a fusing of consciousnesses creates a spiritualist---the master of a single powerful phantom whom the spiritualist can manifest to do her bidding.

**Role:** The spiritualist seeks the occult and esoteric truth about life, death, and the passage beyond, using her phantom as a guide and tool. The connection with her phantom allows her to harness the powers of life and death, thought and nightmare, shadow and revelation.
