Race traits are tied to specific races or ethnicities. In order to select a race trait, your character must be of the specified race or ethnicity. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a [*reincarnation*](/spells/reincarnation/) spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist—only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.

**Note:** The background generator system draws from all lists. If using the background generator, you can take any trait you gain access to through it, even if not of the appropriate race or ethnicity.
