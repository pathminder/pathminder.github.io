The sight of a warlord on the battlefield is enough to strengthen the hearts and wills of those who fight beside him in battle. The warlord may add his Charisma modifier as a morale bonus to Will saves versus fear, death effect, or compulsion effects to all allies within 30 feet of his position. If the warlord maintaining this presence becomes cowed, frightened, panicked or falls prey to a hostile mind-affecting ability (such as one that would stun or daze him), compulsion or death effect, this presence immediately ends.
