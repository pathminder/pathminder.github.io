The warlord has seen some scraps in his day, and he knows how to inspire his allies through some tough moments too. Allies within 30 feet of the warlord gain a morale bonus on combat maneuver checks and to their CMD equal to the warlord's initiation modifier. In addition, those allies do not provoke attacks of opportunity when making combat maneuver attempts.
