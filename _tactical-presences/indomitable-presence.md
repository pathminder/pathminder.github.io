The warlord shines as a beacon to his allies on the field of battle, inspiring them to fight with him to their last breath. All allies within 30 feet of his position gain the benefits of the Die Hard feat, and may add the warlord's Charisma modifier to Fortitude saves versus death effects, fatigue or exhaustion effects, or poison effects as a morale bonus.
