This talisman is made from the bloody tip of a harpy's wing, its end capped in gold and its stringy black feathers still spackled with dried gore. No larger than a human hand, it served as a good luck charm for a famed harpy-hunting sorcerer. The sorcerer traveled throughout the world hunting the cruel creatures after one attacked and killed her mother; she is best known as the slayer of three powerful harpy rangers.

Some say the sorcerer developed an immunity to harpies' captivating songs, allowing her a distinct tactical advantage when she was fighting these dangerous beasts. Others say she learned how to use sonic magic to turn the tides against the monsters. Regardless, the wing tip still carries the psychic energy of one who had mastered fighting such enemies.

An [occultist](/base-classes/occultist/) of 10th level or higher who has learned the evocation implement school and uses the *wing of the shorn harpy* as an implement can replace the evocation spells he knows with the following: 1st---[*ear-piercing scream*](/spells/ear-piercing-scream/), 2nd---[*sonic scream*](/spells/sonic-scream/), 3rd---[*blast barrier*](/spells/blast-barrier/), 4th---[*shout*](/spells/shout/), 5th---[*sonic thrust*](/spells/sonic-thrust/), 6th---[*leashed shackles*](/spells/leashed-shackles/). The occultist cannot use the wing to cast spells whose level is higher than that of the highest-level spell he knows.
