This bright silver or gold +2 blinding heavy steel shield is impossibly light and handy despite its size. It has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it allows the wielder to use [*feather fall*](/spells/feather-fall/) on himself once per day. A creature wearing *celestial armor* while wielding a *celestial shield* may command the armor to provide [*overland flight*](/spells/overland-flight/) rather than [*fly*](/spells/fly/) once per day.
