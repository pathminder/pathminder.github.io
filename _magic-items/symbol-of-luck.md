This translucent sphere of iron-hard glass changes shape to match its bearer's holy symbol within an hour of coming into her possession. After that transformation is complete, when this symbol is used by a halfling with the luck or adaptable luck racial trait to channel energy in order to heal, it also grants those healed a +1 luck bonus on saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the number of dice healed by the channel energy.
