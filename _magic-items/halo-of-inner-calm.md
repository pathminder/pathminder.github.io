This silvery ring looks like a halo. When worn by a [tiefling](/races/tieflings/) it hovers just above his head, though it still uses the head magic item slot. It helps to calm the baser emotions and the dark whispers that plague [tieflings](/races/tieflings/), granting the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against all spells with the emotion descriptor. When worn by a [tiefling](/races/tieflings/) of a good alignment, it provides spell resistance 13 against spells with the evil descriptor and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws.
