*Horseshoes of crushing blows* grant an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made with hoof attacks; this bonus varies based on the item's price. Alternatively, as described for the *amulet of mighty fists*, they can grant melee weapon special abilities so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. *Horseshoes of crushing blows* cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. *Horseshoes of crushing blows* are crafted as sets of four, with each shoe in the set bearing the same enhancements. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal to be effective.

*Horseshoes of crushing blows* may be crafted out of special materials, gaining the usual benefits. For purposes of pricing, they count as a single one-handed weapon weighing 4 pounds (for example, *adamantine horseshoes of crushing blows* would cost an additional 3,000 gp). The materials needed to make *cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows* add no extra costs in and of themselves, but enhancing *cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows* increases the price by the usual 2,000 gp.
