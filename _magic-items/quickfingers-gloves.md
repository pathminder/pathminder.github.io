These dark-colored, skin-tight gloves are typically made of either supple calfskin or silk. A wearer of these gloves with at least 1 rank in Sleight of Hand can perform such a check as a move action by taking a --10 penalty on the check rather than the normal --20. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.
