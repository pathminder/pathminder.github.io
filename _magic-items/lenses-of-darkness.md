Crafted from a dark-colored crystalline material and infused with magical darkness, these lenses fit over the wearer's eyes. When worn by a creature with light sensitivity or light blindness, these lenses protect the wearer against the effect of sunlight, the [*daylight*](/spells/daylight/) spell, or similar light effects. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.
