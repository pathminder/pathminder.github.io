As black as coal, this short sword grows more potent the farther it is kept from light. It acts as a *+1 short sword* when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as *+2 short sword*. When surrounded by supernatural darkness, such as in an area of [*deeper darkness*](/spells/deeper-darkness/), it acts a *+2 short sword* and bestows the benefit of the [Blind-Fight](/feats/blind-fight/) feat to its wielder. In daylight or bright illumination, the sword temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and acts as a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it is no longer in the bright light.
