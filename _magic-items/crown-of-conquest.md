This crown of steel and gold projects an aura of menacing power. The wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks, and whenever he confirms a critical hit, the crown creates a [*prayer*](/spells/prayer/) effect centered on the crown's wearer (caster level 5th).

If the wearer of the crown has the [Leadership](/feats/leadership/) feat, he gains a +1 bonus to his Leadership score and any follower or cohort of the wearer gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against fear effects while within line of sight of the wearer.
