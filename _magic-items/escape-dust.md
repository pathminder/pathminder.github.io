When a handful of this coarse, crystalline powder is thrown at a single creature, it circles around that creature and disrupts its ability to attack and see. Using this dust requires a ranged touch attack by its user (with a range increment of 5 feet), but doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. On a hit, the target is dazzled and cannot make attacks of opportunity or immediate actions for 1 round.
