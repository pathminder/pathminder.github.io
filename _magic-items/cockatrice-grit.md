This magical grit is used by flinging a dose at a creature within 15 feet by as a ranged touch attack. If the *grit* hits, the target takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is [*slow*](/spells/slow/)ed (as the spell) for 1 round as its body starts slowly turning to stone. Each round that follows, the victim can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the start of its turn as a free action to end the effect; otherwise, it takes an additional 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is slowed for 1 more round. This effect can last for a maximum of 11 rounds. If this Dexterity damage ever meets or exceeds the victim's actual Dexterity score, the creature becomes petrified permanently, as if by flesh to stone. A dose of *cockatrice grit* is consumed when it is used, and doesn't activate until it has been thrown---the *grit* can be handled safely.
