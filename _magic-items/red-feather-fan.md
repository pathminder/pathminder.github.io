This fan is made of copper fashioned into a dozen small feathers mounted on a ring-shaped bone handle. Once per day, the bearer can hold it and speak a command word to counterspell a darkness effect (as if using [*daylight*](/spells/daylight/)) or counterspell a light effect (as if using [*deeper darkness*](/spells/deeper-darkness/)). If activated in an area of overlapping light and darkness effects, the fan randomly counterspells one of them, leaving the other intact.
