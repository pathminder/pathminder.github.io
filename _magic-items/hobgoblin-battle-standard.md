A *battle standard* is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects.

A *battle standard* may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.

**Despair:** Enemies of the bearer of a *hobgoblin battle standard of despair* are sickened while within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become dazed for 1 round.

**Ferocity:** Allies of the bearer of a *hobgoblin battle standard of ferocity* gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the banner.

**Iron Resolve:** Allies of the bearer of a *hobgoblin battle standard of iron resolve* gain 10 temporary hit points and the benefits of the [Diehard](/feats/diehard/) feat for as long as they are within 30 feet of the banner. The temporary hit points can only be gained once per day per creature.
