This belt is made of specially treated stone plates held together by thick iron chain. Every 24 hours, the belt's wearer gains DR 10/adamantine until the belt absorbs 100 points of damage, at which point the belt becomes useless for the remainder of the 24-hour period. When first worn, or after each time this belt is taken off, it must worn for 24 consecutive hours in order for its magic to take effect again.
