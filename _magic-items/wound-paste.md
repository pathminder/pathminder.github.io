Prized by slavers as an affordable way to stop a captive from bleeding to death, a dose of *wound paste* acts as a [*stabilize*](/spells/stabilize/) spell when slathered on a dying creature. Applying *wound paste* is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A pot of *wound paste* contains 5 doses.
