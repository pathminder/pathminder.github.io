*Metamagic gems* can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way *metamagic rods* are used, save that *metamagic gems* are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a *metamagic gem* to a spell, you need only use the *metamagic gem* as an additional material component for the spell in question.

When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a *metamagic gem*, the spell
slot: of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one *metamagic gem* on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a *metamagic rod*, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot: of the spell being cast.

Use of a *metamagic gem* does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a full-round action when using a *metamagic gem*, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for *quickening diamonds*, which can be used as a swift action).

The *metamagic gems* presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other *metamagic gems* based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created---their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot: by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new *gem* should have a corresponding unique gemstone type associated with it.
