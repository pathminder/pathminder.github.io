These finely crafted yellow-ivory pipes are bound in bronze and decorated with bits of amber. If the possessor learns the proper tune, once per day he can use these pipes to summon 1d4+1 dire rats as if using [*summon monster III*](/spells/summon-monster-iii/). The summoned dire rats also have the swarming racial trait, and count as [ratfolk](/races/ratfolk/) for the purposes of the [ratfolk](/races/ratfolk/)'s swarming racial trait.
