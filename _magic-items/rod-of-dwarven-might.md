This dwarven version of the more famous *rod of lordly might* has no spell-like powers; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf's racial traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane powers of a *rod of lordly might*, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to dwarven preferences.

In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +1 returning light hammer.

When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 dwarven longhammer.

When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 dwarven waraxe.

When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +2 light crossbow or +2 heavy crossbow.
