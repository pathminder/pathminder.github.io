Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized star-ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several long spikes. A *soulbound eye* is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear---they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A *soulbound eye* must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow---the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the user and the victim.

Once implanted, the *soulbound eye* allows the user to observe the world around the victim through the victim's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the victim and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. While the *soulbound eye*'s victim is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, the master can use the *soulbound eye* as a conduit for [*hold monster*](/spells/hold-monster/), [*modify memory*](/spells/modify-memory/), [*pain strike*](/spells/pain-strike/), or [*suggestion*](/spells/suggestion/) spells cast by the master, treating the wearer as the target of the spell, no matter the distance between the master and victim. The victim is allowed any normal saves or spell resistance against spells cast through the *soulbound eye*.

An implanted *soulbound eye* functions like a cursed item once it is in place---it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/) or [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/). Once removed, a *soulbound eye* crumbles to fragments.
