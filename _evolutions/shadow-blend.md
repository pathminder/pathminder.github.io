In any condition of illumination other than bright light, the eidolon disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). If it has the [shadow form](/evolutions/shadow-form/) evolution, it instead gains total concealment (50% miss chance). The eidolon can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
