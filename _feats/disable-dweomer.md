  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can disable a magic item, suppressing it for a short time.
prerequisites:
  - "[Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) 5 ranks"
  - "[Use Magic Device](/skills/use-magic-device/) 5 ranks"
  - trapfinding
benefit: |
  You can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to suppress the magic of a non-artifact magic item for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the suppression. Using [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) in this way takes 2d4 rounds, with a DC of 15 + the item's caster level.
