title: Guard's Glare
sources:
  - Path of War
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Scared creatures have a hard time moving away from you
flavor_text: Your unflinching stare keeps your targets terrified of fleeing from you.
prerequisites:
  - armiger's mark class feature
  - Intimidate 4 ranks
benefit: A creature that is demoralized, frightened, shaken, or panicked and marked by your armiger's mark must make a Will save (DC 10 + half your warder level + Intelligence modifier) to move in a direction away from you. A creature only needs to make this save once per round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
