  You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You gain a breath weapon that is determined by your scale coloration by either the [Draconic Aspect](/feats/draconic-aspect/) feat or the dragon-scaled racial trait. Using a breath weapon is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use your breath weapon once per day. Creatures within the area of your breath weapon who succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Constitution modifier) take only half damage.
