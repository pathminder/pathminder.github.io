sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
flavor_text: You can close the distance when a foe tries to move away.
prerequisites:
  - base attack bonus +1
benefit: |
  Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.
