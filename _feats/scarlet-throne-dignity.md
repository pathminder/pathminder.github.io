sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Expend a counter to attempt to negate an enemy attack and take a 5-foot step
flavor_text: Noble training has enabled you to withstand attacks that would harm those of lesser breeding.
prerequisites:
  - "[Scarlet Throne Style](/feats/scarlet-throne-style/)"
  - Sense Motive 7 ranks
benefit: You can expend a readied maneuver as an immediate action in response to an attack being made against you. If you do, make an attack roll with a weapon you are wielding. If your attack roll is higher than your opponent's, their attack is negated, and you can take a 5-foot step, even if you have already moved or taken a 5-foot step this round.
