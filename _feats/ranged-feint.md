flavor_text: You can mislead foes about your aim with ranged attacks.
prerequisites:
  - Base attack bonus +2
  - Bluff 3 ranks
benefit: |
  You can feint with a ranged weapon by throwing a thrown weapon or firing one arrow, bolt, bullet, or other piece of ammunition; this feint takes the same action as normal to feint, but depending on your weapon, you might have to reload or draw another weapon afterward. When you successfully use a ranged feint, you deny that enemy its Dexterity bonus to AC against your ranged attacks as well as your melee attacks for the same duration as normal. If your feints normally deny a foe its Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks other than your own, this applies only against others' melee attacks.
normal: |
  You can feint only with a melee weapon, and only against a creature you threaten with that weapon.
