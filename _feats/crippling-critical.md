title: Crippling Critical
tags:
  - Combat
  - Critical
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.
prerequisites:
  - [Critical Focus](/feats/critical-focus/)
  - base attack bonus +13
benefit: |
  Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 [Fly](/skills/fly/) check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.
special: |
  You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [Critical Mastery](/feats/critical-mastery/).
