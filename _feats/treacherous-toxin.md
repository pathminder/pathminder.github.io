  - "Pathfinder Player Companion: Dirty Tactics Toolbox"
flavor_text: You twist a blade to force more of the poison on it into an enemy's bloodstream.

  - base attack bonus +5
  - sneak attack class feature
benefit: |
  When you make a sneak attack with a poisoned weapon, you can forgo some of your sneak attack damage to increase the save DC of your poison, increasing the poison's save DC by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage you forgo. This can't cause the save DC to exceed 15 + 1/2 your character level.
