title: Pushing Assault
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.
prerequisites:
  - Str 15
  - "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"
  - base attack bonus +1
benefit: |
  When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/). If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.
