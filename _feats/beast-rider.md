sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: You gain the service of a monstrous companion or mount.
prerequisites:
  - animal companion or mount class feature
  - character level 7th
  - "[half-orc](/races/half-orcs/) or orc"
benefit: |
  Select one of the following creature types: elephant, pteranodon, rhinoceros, stegosaurus, or triceratops. Add this creature type to your list of possible animal companions or mounts. When summoning a creature of the selected type to serve as a mount or companion, treat your effective druid level as if it were two levels higher (to a maximum of your character level). If the creature is large enough for you to ride, it gains the combat training general purpose (see Handle Animal) at no cost.
