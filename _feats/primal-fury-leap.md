title: Primal Fury Leap
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Charge creatures in the air as if you could fly, and reduce the falling damage you’d take afterwards
flavor_text: Not even the sky is safe from your wrath.
prerequisites:
  - "[Primal Fury Style](/feats/primal-fury-style/)"
  - "[Primal Fury Slash](/feats/primal-fury-slash/)"
  - Survival 11 ranks
benefit: You can make charge attacks against opponents in the air. If you do, you are treated as having a fly speed equal to your land speed during the charge, with good maneuverability. If you do not normally have a fly speed, you fall after this charge. You reduce the effective distance of this fall by 10 feet per initiator level.
