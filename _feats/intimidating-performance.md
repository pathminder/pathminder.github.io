  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: Your performance strikes fear in the hearts of foes.
prerequisites:
  - ability to start a performance or a raging song as a move action
  - bardic performance or raging song class feature
benefit: |
  When you start a performance or a raging song as a move action or a swift action, you can use a standard action to [demoralize a foe](/skills/intimidate/), attempting a [Perform](/skills/perform/) check appropriate to your performance in place of the [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check. Your performance must have an audible component. This is a sonic effect.

  If you can start a performance as a swift action and you have the [Dazzling Display](/feats/dazzling-display/) feat, you can gain the benefit of [Dazzling Display](/feats/dazzling-display/) by succeeding at a [Perform](/skills/perform/) check in place of an [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check.
