flavor_text: When you fight giants, your powerful blows combine with skills learned from generations of your people to quickly even the odds.
prerequisites:
  - dwarf or gnome
  - defensive training racial trait
  - "[Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/two-weapon-fighting/) or flurry of blows class feature"
  - "[Weapon Focus](/feats/weapon-focus/) with both wielded weapons"
benefit: |
  Once per round, when wielding a bludgeoning weapon in each hand against a creature with the giant subtype, if you hit the creature with your off-hand weapon after you hit with your primary weapon, roll the damage dice for your off-hand weapon twice and add the results together before adding any bonuses. Such extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit.
