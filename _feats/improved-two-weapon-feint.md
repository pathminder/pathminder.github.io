tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: Your primary weapon keeps a foe off balance, allowing you to slip your off-hand weapon past his defenses.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 17
  - Int 13
  - "[Combat Expertise](/feats/combat-expertise/)"
  - "[Improved Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting/)"
  - "[Two-Weapon Feint](/feats/two-weapon-feint/)"
  - "[Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/two-weapon-fighting/)"
  - base attack bonus +6
benefit: |
  While using [Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/two-weapon-fighting/) to make melee attacks, you can forgo your first primary-hand melee attack to make a [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) check to feint an opponent. If you successfully feint, that opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC until the end of your turn.
