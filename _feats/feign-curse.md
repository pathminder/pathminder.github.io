title: Feign Curse
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: You can fool others into believing you have ensorcelled them.
prerequisites:
  - Deceitful
  - Bluff 5 ranks
  - Spellcraft 1 rank
benefit: |
  As a standard action, you can feign placing a curse on a target. The target must attempt a Sense Motive or Spellcraft check (whichever skill that target has a higher bonus with) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff + your Charisma modifier, with a bonus on his skill check equal to any conditional bonus he has on saving throws against hexes or curses (like from the spell [*hex ward*](/spells/hex-ward/)). If he fails, he becomes plagued by self-doubt and second-guesses himself. For his next two attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks, he rolls twice and takes the lower result; for every 5 ranks of Bluff you possess beyond 5, this ability affects an additional roll. This is a mind-affecting ffect, and it doesn't work if the target is immune to curses. Once you attempt to feign putting a curse on a creature, you cannot do so again against the same creature for 24 hours, and if the target succeeds at detecting your ruse, he gains a +10 bonus against future attempts.
