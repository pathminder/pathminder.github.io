flavor_text: Your enemies are living weapons in your hands.
prerequisites:
  - [Improved Bull Rush](/feats/improved-bull-rush/)
  - [*Ki* Throw](/feats/ki-throw/)
benefit: |
  When using the *Ki* Throw feat, you may throw your target into any square you threaten that is occupied by another creature. Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a --4 penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the thrown creature lands prone in the secondary target's square, while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked prone in an adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands prone in the nearest square you threaten adjacent to the secondary target.

  If you throw a Large or larger creature into an area containing multiple secondary targets, you take an additional penalty of --4 on your combat maneuver check for each target after the first.
special: |
  A monk may take this as a bonus feat at 14th level.
