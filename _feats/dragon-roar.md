sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty roar.
prerequisites:
  - Str 15
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - "[Dragon Style](/feats/dragon-style/)"
  - "[Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/)"
  - "[Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) 8 ranks"
benefit: |
  You gain one additional [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempt per day. While using [Dragon Style](/feats/dragon-style/), as a standard action you can expend two [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.
special: |
  If you have the [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) feat, you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.
