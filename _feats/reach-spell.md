flavor_text: Your spells go farther than normal.
benefit: |
  You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long.

  A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher.

  Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks. Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.
