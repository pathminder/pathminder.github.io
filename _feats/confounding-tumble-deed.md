title: Confounding Tumble Deed
tags:
  - Panache
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.
prerequisites:
  - "[Amateur Swashbuckler](/feats/amateur-swashbuckler/) feat or panache class feature"
  - "[Canny Tumble](/feats/canny-tumble/)"
  - "[Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) 7 ranks"
benefit: |
  When you use [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.
