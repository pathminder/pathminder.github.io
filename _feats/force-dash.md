title: Force Dash
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can absorb the magic in your force spells to give you a concentrated burst of speed.
prerequisites:
  - base attack bonus +4
  - ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells
  - ability to cast at least one arcane [force](/descriptors/force/) spell
benefit: |
  As a swift action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane [force](/descriptors/force/) spell (or if you are a spontaneous caster, a spell slot of the same level as an arcane force spell you know) to give yourself an enhancement bonus to speed. The bonus gained is equal to 10 feet × the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus applies to all forms of movement, and it lasts 1 round. If you charge while this bonus is in effect, you do not take the normal --2 penalty to AC until the start of your next turn.
