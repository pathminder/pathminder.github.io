  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can summon a torrent of water to blast your enemies, chilling them to the bone.
prerequisites:
  - Con 15
  - Wis 17
  - "[Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/)"
  - "[Marid Spirit](/feats/marid-spirit/)"
  - "[Marid Style](/feats/marid-style/)"
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th
benefit: |
  While using [Marid Style](/feats/marid-style/), as a standard action, you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attack and are entangled in ice as per the [Marid Spirit](/feats/marid-spirit/) feat. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled.
