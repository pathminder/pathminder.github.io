title: Spell Bluff
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You know the principles of arcane dueling, and when fighting other spellcasters, you have learned to hide the true nature of your spells until the last possible moment.
prerequisites:
  - "[Bluff](/skills/bluff/) 5 ranks"
  - "[Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/) 5 ranks"
benefit: |
  If another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell.

  Because you have studied how to mask the recognizable elements of your spellcasting, you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to identify and counter an opponent's spell if it is a spell you know or have in your spellbook.
