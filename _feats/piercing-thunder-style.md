summary: Creatures provoke attacks of opportunity when entering squares you threaten with a reach weapon
flavor_text: You can use the natural reach of a spear or polearm with greater effectiveness.
prerequisites:
  - Acrobatics 3 ranks
  - one [Piercing Thunder](/martial-disciplines/piercing-thunder/) stance known
benefit: While you are wielding a reach weapon, opponents provoke an attack of opportunity when they enter a square you threaten. If an opponent would also provoke an attack of opportunity from leaving a threatened square when they do, they still only provoke a single attack of opportunity from you.
special: Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes.
