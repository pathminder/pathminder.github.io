  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or knock back your foes.
prerequisites:
  - Con 13
  - Wis 13
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +8
benefit: |
  You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.
special: |
  A hungry ghost monk receives [Punishing Kick](/feats/punishing-kick/) as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a punishing kick attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.
