sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: Your knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental fire.
prerequisites:
  - Con 15
  - Wis 17
  - "[Efreeti Style](/feats/efreeti-style/)"
  - "[Efreeti Stance](/feats/efreeti-stance/)"
  - "[Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/)"
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th
benefit: |
  While using [Efreeti Style](/feats/efreeti-style/), as a standard action, you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to unleash a 15-foot cone-shaped burst of flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) and catch on fire. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching on fire.
