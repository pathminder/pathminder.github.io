summary: Change the damage type of your Solar Wind maneuvers by changing your active element
flavor_text: You've learned to use the many styles of the Solar Wind discipline.
prerequisites:
  - one [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) maneuver known
  - one [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) stance known
benefit: You gain the ability to change your active element if you cannot already. Any [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) maneuver you initiate that deals fire damage instead deals damage of your active element's associated energy type (see the [Elemental Flux](/martial-disciplines/elemental-flux/) discipline for more information on active elements).
