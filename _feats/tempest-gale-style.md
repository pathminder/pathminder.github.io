  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
  - Style
summary: You can make ranged bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, and trip attempts
flavor_text: Your arrows and slings are able to strike targets in unusual ways.
prerequisites:
  - Sleight of Hand 3 ranks
  - one [Tempest Gale](/martial-disciplines/tempest-gale/) stance known
benefit: You can make bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, and trip attempts using a ranged weapon against any target within your first range increment. Attempting a combat maneuver in this way is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (unless you have the appropriate improved combat maneuver feat). You use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for determining your combat maneuver bonus for these attempts.
special: Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes.
