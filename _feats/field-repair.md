title: Field Repair
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can repair your broken weapon or armor to serviceability even without the benefits of artisan tools.
prerequisites:
  - "[Craft](/skills/craft/) 4 ranks"
benefit: |
  If you are trained in a [Craft](/skills/craft/) skill appropriate to a broken item, you can repair that item with no raw material cost and no penalty on your [Craft](/skills/craft/) skill check for using improvised tools. If you spend a day, the item regains 1 hit point plus one-quarter of its original hit points. Alternatively, if the item gained the broken condition because it is a firearm that has misfired or a siege engine that suffered a mishap, or has the broken condition because it has the fragile weapon quality (or some similar quality), you can make a [Craft](/skills/craft/) check with the DC it takes to craft that item (see the table below). If the check succeeds, the item loses the broken condition.
