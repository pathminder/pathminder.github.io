tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: Your unarmed strikes are as precise as they are powerful, but they leave you open and you can pursue foes with blinding speed.
prerequisites:
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"
  - "[Tiger Claws](/feats/tiger-claws/)"
  - "[Tiger Style](/feats/tiger-style/)"
  - base attack bonus +9 or monk level 8th
benefit: |
  While using the [Tiger Style](/feats/tiger-style/) feat, you can apply the penalty from [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) to your AC instead of attack rolls. Additionally, once per round as a swift action, you can move up to half your speed closer to a target you hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against on this turn or your last turn.
