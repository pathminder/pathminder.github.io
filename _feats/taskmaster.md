flavor_text: You intimidate weaker allies into reckless ferocity.
prerequisites:
  - "[Demoralizing Lash](/feats/demoralizing-lash/)"
  - "[Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) 5 ranks"
  - "[hobgoblin](/races/hobgoblins/)"
benefit: |
  As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects. However, the ally also takes a --2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check with the same DC used to demoralize your ally.
special: |
   If you have 10 or more ranks in [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/), the morale bonus increases to +2.
