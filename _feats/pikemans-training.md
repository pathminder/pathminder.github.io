summary: Wield a polearm in one hand while using a shield
flavor_text: Militaries across the land rely on lines of pikemen carrying both their long spears and a shield. You are familiar with this fighting style.
prerequisites:
  - base attack bonus +1
benefit: You can wield a normally two-handed polearm or spear in one hand, provided you are wielding a light or heavy shield in your other hand. When wielding a weapon in this manner, you treat it in all ways as being a one-handed weapon, rather than a weapon of its normal handedness.
