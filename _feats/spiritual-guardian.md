title: Spiritual Guardian
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: Your spiritual guardians are unusually powerful.
prerequisites:
  - Ability to cast [*spiritual weapon*](/spells/spiritual-weapon/) or [*spiritual ally*](/spells/spiritual-ally/)
  - spirit magic class feature
benefit: |
  Whenever you cast [*spiritual weapon*](/spells/spiritual-weapon/), [*spiritual ally*](/spells/spiritual-ally/), or a similar spell that grants you a spiritual guardian, that guardian uses your shaman level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance as well as on damage rolls.
