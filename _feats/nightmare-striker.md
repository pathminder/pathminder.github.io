sources:

flavor_text: Your [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/) not only illuminates your foes, but it also shows you their weaknesses.
prerequisites:
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - "[Nightmare Fist](/feats/nightmare-fist/)"
  - "[Nightmare Weaver](/feats/nightmare-weaver/)"
  - "[Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/)"
  - "[Heal](/skills/heal/) 5 ranks"
  - ability to cast [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/).
benefit: |
  While a [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/) you have cast (not one cast from a spell completion or spell trigger item) outlines an opponent, the DC for that opponent to resist your [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempts increases by +2. If you hit an opponent with a [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempt, and that opponent fails her saving throw, you can render the target shaken for 1d2 rounds plus 1 round for every 5 by which the opponent failed her save.
