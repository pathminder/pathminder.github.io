title: Draconic Glide
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: You possess draconic defenses and wings that allow you to glide.
prerequisites:
  - "[Draconic Aspect](/feats/draconic-aspect/)"
  - "[kobold](/races/kobolds/)"
benefit: |
  You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You grow a pair of wings that you can use to fall and glide at a safe pace. You can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using [*feather fall*](/feats/feather-fall/). When falling safely, you may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.
special: |
   If you have the gliding wings racial trait, you don’t need to make a Fly check to glide, and you can move 10 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.
