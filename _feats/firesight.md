title: Firesight
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: Fire no longer blinds you, and smoke conceals nothing from your gaze.
prerequisites:
  - "[Ifrit](/races/Ifrits/)"
benefit: |
  You can see through fire and smoke without penalty, ignoring any cover or concealment bonuses from fire and smoke. This does not allow you to see anything you could not otherwise see (for example, invisible creatures are still invisible). You are immune to the dazzled condition.
