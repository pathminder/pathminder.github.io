title: Expanded Preparation
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can prepare more spells than other arcanists can.
prerequisites:
  - Arcanist level 1st
benefit: |
  You gain an extra spell prepared of the highest level you can currently cast as an arcanist when selecting this feat. This is in addition to the number of spells you can normally prepare from your spellbook. You can instead add two spells prepared, but both of these slots must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can currently cast as an arcanist when selecting this feat. You must choose which benefit you gain when you take this feat, and the extra spells prepared do not change level when you gain access to higher-level spells.
special: |
  You can take this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you can choose either benefit.
