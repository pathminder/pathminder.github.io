title: Veiled Moon Shunt
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Once per round, expend a readied maneuver to forcibly teleport a creature you hit a short distance
flavor_text: You twist an enemy's location, shunting them into a dangerous position of weakness.
prerequisites:
  - "[Veiled Moon Style](/feats/veiled-moon-style/)"
  - Stealth 11 ranks
benefit: Once per round, when you hit with an attack, you can expend a readied maneuver as a free action to forcibly teleport your target. That creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the expended maneuver's level + your highest initiation modifier) or be teleported to any unoccupied space within 30 feet of them that you can see. You need not teleport them to a location that can support them; you can teleport them into the air, into difficult terrain, or into dangerous situations as you see fit. This is a supernatural ability, and is considered a Veiled Moon maneuver for the purposes of save DCs and abilities such as the Discipline Focus feat.
