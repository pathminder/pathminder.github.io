flavor_text: Discharging your disturbing glamer as you strike a telling blow, you haunt a foe with lingering fear.
prerequisites:
  - Cha 13
  - gnome magic racial trait
  - "[Haunted Gnome](/feats/haunted-gnome/)"
  - "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (arcana) 3 ranks"
benefit: |
  You gain one use of your gnome magic that is independent of your gnome magic spell-like abilities. When you wish to cast a gnome magic spell-like ability for which you have no daily uses remaining, you can expend this independent use to do so.

  Further, while you are under the effect of [*haunted fey aspect*](/spells/haunted-fey-aspect/) you can discharge that spell as a free action after you hit an opponent with a charge attack or score a critical hit against an opponent. If you do, that opponent becomes shaken for 1 round.
