title: Legendary Influence
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: Each legend grants you more of its power in return for greater influence.
prerequisites:
  - lesser spirit power class feature
benefit: |
  Immediately select one feat (other than an item creation feat) for each spirit you can channel. Whenever you perform a seance to channel a spirit, you can allow the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you to gain access to that spirit's Legendary Influence feat for as long as you channel that spirit. You can use this bonus feat as a prerequisite for any feats granted by a spirit power (such as the champion's legendary champion ability), but not for any other feats.
