title: Concussive Spell (Metamagic)
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You cause creatures to be disoriented when you affect them with a spell that has the sonic descriptor.
benefit: |
  With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of energy that rattles creatures affected by the spell. A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a --2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor.

  A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
