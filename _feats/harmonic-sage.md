title: Harmonic Sage
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: Your thorough understanding of acoustics in artificial surroundings allows you to improve the power of your bardic performance.
prerequisites:
  - Bardic performance class feature
  - "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (engineering) 5 ranks"
benefit: |
  While inside an artificial structure, you can spend a free action to make a DC 15 [Knowledge (engineering)](/skills/knowledge-engineering/) check when you begin your bardic performance. Success on this check allows you to do one of the following.

  *Self-Harmonize:* By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1.

  *Reverberation:* You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.
normal: |
  A bardic performance lasts only as long as you maintain it.
