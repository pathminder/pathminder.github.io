  Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is permanently deafened. A successful Fortitude save reduces the deafness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on deaf creatures. This deafness can be cured by *heal, regeneration, remove deafness, *or a similar ability.

  You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [Critical Mastery](/feats/critical-mastery/).
