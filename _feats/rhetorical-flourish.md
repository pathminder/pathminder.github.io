title: Rhetorical Flourish
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You rapidly change topics and employ confusing rhetoric to distract people from your true intent.
prerequisites:
  - Cha 13
  - "[Persuasive](/feats/persuasive/)"
benefit: |
  When using the [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) skill to make a request or change a creature's attitude, you can use verbal misdirection. To do so, make a [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) check against that creature. If you succeed, you gain a +4 bonus on your next [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check against that creature if the check is made within the next minute. If you fail by 5 or more, you instead take a --2 penalty on your next [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check against that creature.

  Alternatively, you can use this feat to retry a single failed [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check against a creature. You take a --4 penalty on your [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) check when using [Rhetorical Flourish](/feats/rhetorical-flourish/) in this way. If you succeed, rather than gaining this feat's normal bonus, you can retry your last [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check against the creature if that check was made in the past minute.<span class="char-style-override-11"> </span>
