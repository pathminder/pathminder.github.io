title: Threnodic Spell (Metamagic)
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You can convert mind-affecting magic to necromantic power capable of controlling undead.
prerequisites:
  - "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (religion) 6 ranks"
  - "[Spell Focus](/feats/spell-focus/) (necromancy)"
benefit: |
  This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures.

  A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level.
normal: |
  Undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.
