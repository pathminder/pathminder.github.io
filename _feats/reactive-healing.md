title: Reactive Healing
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can channel healing energy in response to an attack that would knock you unconscious.
prerequisites:
  - "[Quick Channel](/feats/quick-channel/) or [Quicken Spell](/feats/quicken-spell/)"
  - channel energy or lay on hands class feature
benefit: |
  When the damage from an attack or an effect would reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points, you can expend one use of channel energy (of a form that would heal you) or lay on hands as an immediate action to heal yourself. The healing affects only you, even if it would normally affect others.
