tags:

summary: Use Survival instead of Acrobatics to move through threatened squares, and you can charge through difficult terrain and opponents’ spaces
flavor_text: Your fury drives you to close with your foes so that you can tear into them more easily.
prerequisites:
  - Survival 3 ranks
  - one [Primal Fury](/martial-disciplines/primal-fury/) stance known
benefit: You can make Survival checks in place of Acrobatics checks to move through threatened squares. In addition, you can charge through difficult terrain and spaces containing opponents. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for entering an opponent's space when charging, although you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for moving through an opponent's threatened area.
special: Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes.
