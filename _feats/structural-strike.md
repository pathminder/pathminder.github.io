  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: You use your knowledge of how things fit together to find ways to punch through the defenses of any foe.
prerequisites:
  - Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks
  - precise strike class feature or precise strike deed
benefit: |
  When using the duelist's or swashbuckler's precise strike, you can make a single strike as a standard action against an opponent that would be otherwise immune to your precise strike damage. If you hit, you deal your precise strike damage as normal against this enemy. When using the swashbuckler's precise strike deed, you can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to deal your regular precise strike damage on a single attack against an opponent that would typically be immune. If you have both class features, you can use either option in order to apply the full damage from both versions of precise strike.

  Additionally, against opponents with a chance of immunity to your precise strike (such as an opponent wearing armor with the *fortification* special ability), this feat reduces their chance of negating your precise strikes by 10%.
