  You can attempt a skill check to aid an ally within 30 feet with a skill in which you are trained. This takes 1 minute, and during that time, you need only speak and be heard by your chosen ally to offer this aid. The bonus you grant is +2, regardless of any other effects that would alter your aid another bonus. This bonus applies to all checks the ally attempts with that skill for 1 day and does not stack with any other aid another bonus. Whether you succeed at or fail the skill check to aid another, you can attempt to use this ability only once per day for each ally.
