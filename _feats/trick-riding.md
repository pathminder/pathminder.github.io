title: Trick Riding
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you can make it look like art.
prerequisites:
  - [Ride](/skills/ride/) 9 ranks
  - [Mounted Combat](/feats/mounted-combat/)
benefit: |
  While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to make [Ride](/skills/ride/) skill with a DC of 15 or lower. You do not take a --5 penalty for riding a mount bareback. You can make a check using [Mounted Combat](/feats/mounted-combat/) to negate a hit on your mount twice per round instead of just once.
