flavor_text: You can move with the quiet grace of an owl.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - Skill Focus (Stealth)
  - Stealth 1 rank
benefit: |
  While using this style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Stealth to determine your Stealth skill modifier (as usual, this does not replace your ranks for other purposes, such as determining the effects of Skill Focus). While in this stance and using Stealth, you can charge at a --10 penalty beyond the penalty you take for using Stealth at full speed (which is typically --5). Foes that fail their Perception checks and don't otherwise notice you (for instance, with an ability like blindsight) are denied their Dexterity bonuses to AC against all attacks you make against them during or at the end of that charge instead of just against the first attack.
