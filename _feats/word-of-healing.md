title: Word of Healing
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: Using the same divine energy as your lay on hands ability, you can heal others at a distance.
prerequisites:
  - lay on hands class feature
benefit: |
  You may use your lay on hands to heal another creature at a range of 30 feet as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to speak and have a free hand to use this ability. The target heals half the amount they would have healed if you had touched them, but gains the benefits of your mercies as normal.
