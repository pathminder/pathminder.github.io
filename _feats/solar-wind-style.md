title: Solar Wind Style
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
  - Style
summary: Your ranged attacks deal additional fire damage and outline creatures with *faerie fire*
flavor_text: Your arrows glow as bright as the sun.
prerequisites:
  - Perception 3 ranks
  - one [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) stance known
benefit: Your ranged attacks deal 1 point of additional fire damage. At character level 5th and at every five levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can choose to have your target become outlined as if by a *faerie fire* spell, with a caster level equal to the your initiator level. Successive uses of this ability against the same creature do not stack; instead, they extend the duration. You can suppress or resume the light on an affected creature you can see as a free action. This is a supernatural ability.
special: Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes.
