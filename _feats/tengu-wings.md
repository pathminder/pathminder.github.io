title: Tengu Wings
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: You can grow wings that allow you to fly.
prerequisites:
  - character level 5th
  - "[tengu](/races/tengus/)"
benefit: |
  Once per day, you can sprout a pair of giant black crow's wings, granting you a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). This spell-like ability otherwise functions as [*beast shape I*](/spells/beast-shape-i/) (though you do not gain any other benefits of that spell) with a caster level equal to your level.
