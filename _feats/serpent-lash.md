prerequisites:
  - "[Weapon Finesse](/feats/weapon-finesse/)"
  - proficient in whip
benefit: |
  As a standard action, you can make a disarm or trip maneuver with your whip. If it succeeds, you can make an additional disarm or trip maneuver with the same bonus against a target adjacent to the first and also within your whip's reach.

  In addition, you can use your whip to perform reposition maneuvers, though you take a --4 penalty on your CMB and you may only move the target toward you from its original position.
