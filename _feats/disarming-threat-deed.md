title: Disarming Threat Deed
tags:
  - Panache
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: Even your threats are curiously charming.
prerequisites:
  - "[Amateur Swashbuckler](/feats/amateur-swashbuckler/) or panache class feature"
  - "[Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) 2 ranks"
  - "[Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) 2 ranks"
benefit: |
  When you succeed at an [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check to force an opponent to act friendly toward you, you can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to regard you with indifference when the duration of the effect expires. A target influenced in this manner is unlikely to report you to authorities.
norma: |
  An opponent forced to act friendly toward you by [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) becomes unfriendly when the duration expires, and is likely to report you to the authorities.
