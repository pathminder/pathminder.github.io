title: Greater Spell Specialization
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You can sacrifice a prepared spell in order to spontaneously cast your specialized spell.
prerequisites:
  - Int 13
  - "[Spell Focus](/feats/spell-focus/)"
  - "[Spell Specialization](/feats/spell-specialization/)"
  - able to prepare 5th-level spells
benefit: |
  By sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level than your specialized spell, you may spontaneously cast your specialized spell. The specialized spell is treated as its normal level, regardless of the spell slot used to cast it. You may add a metamagic feat to the spell by increasing the spell slot and casting time, just like a cleric spontaneously casting a *cure* or *inflict* spell with a metamagic feat.
