sources:
  - Path of War
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Use armiger's mark to be the target of an attack
flavor_text: You are swift in positioning yourself to aid your allies.
prerequisites:
  - armiger's mark class feature
benefit: When a creature within your reach who is marked by your armiger's mark targets an ally with a melee or ranged attack, you can expend a use of your armiger's mark as an immediate action to force the opponent's attack to target you instead. You are considered the target for all effects of the attack (the creature must make a successful attack roll, you are allowed a save, if any, etc.).
