flavor_text: With a sly maneuver, you force a grappled opponent into the path of an incoming attack.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - "[Improved Grapple](/feats/improved-grapple/)"
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +6
benefit: |
  As an immediate action while you are grappling an adjacent creature, you can make a grapple combat maneuver check against that creature to gain cover against a single attack. If you are successful and the attack misses you, that attack targets the creature you used as cover, using the same attack roll. You cannot use this feat against a creature grappling you, and the cover you gain ends after the attack you gained cover against is resolved.
