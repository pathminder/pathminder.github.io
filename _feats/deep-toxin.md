title: Deep Toxin
sources:
  - "Pathfinder Player Companion: Dirty Tactics Toolbox"
flavor_text: You can deliver poisons deep into a foe's flesh.
prerequisites:
  - "[Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +6
  - Craft (poison) 6 ranks or poison use class feature
benefit: |
  When you use a poisoned weapon to make a [Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/), you increase the poison's duration by one frequency increment (for example, a dose of large scorpion venom would last for 7 rounds instead of 6 and a dose of drow poison would last for 3 minutes instead of 2). The poison takes effect immediately and does not have an onset time.
