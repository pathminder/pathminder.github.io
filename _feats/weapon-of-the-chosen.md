prerequisites:
  - "[Weapon Focus](/feats/weapon-focus/) with deity's favored weapon"
  - must worship and receive spells from a deity
benefit: |
  As a swift action, you can call upon your deity to guide an attack you make with your deity's favored weapon. On your next attack in that round with that weapon, your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or striking an incorporeal creature. If your attack misses because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance one time to see whether you actually hit.
