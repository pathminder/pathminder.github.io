title: "*Ki* Throw"
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw enemies.
prerequisites:
  - [Improved Trip](/feats/improved-trip/)
  - [Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)
benefit: |
  On a successful unarmed trip attack against a target your size or smaller, you may throw the target prone in any square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the creature into a space occupied by other creatures.
special: |
  A monk may gain *Ki* Throw as a bonus feat at 10th level. A monk with this feat can affect creatures larger than his own size by spending 1 *ki* point per size category difference.
