title: Resilient Armor
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: When you enhance your armor or shield, you gain a measure of damage reduction.
prerequisites:
  - divine bond (armor or shield) or sacred armor class feature
benefit: |
  While your armor or shield is under the effect of your divine bond or your sacred armor ability, you gain an amount of damage reduction equal to your armor's enhancement bonus (including the bonus from your divine bond or sacred armor) against the first attack to strike you in each round. An adamantine weapon overcomes this damage reduction, but any attack against you made with such a weapon does not count against this effect's duration.
