flavor_text: Your enemies recoil in disgust when they strike you.
prerequisites:
  - aberration, ooze, or undead type and/or evil or reptilian subtype
benefit: |
  When you take damage, you exude a horrible stench. Anyone within 10 feet of you must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Die + your Constitution modifier) or be sickened for 1 minute. This is a poison effect.
