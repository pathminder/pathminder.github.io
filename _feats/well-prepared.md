title: Well-Prepared
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.
prerequisites:
  - halfling
benefit: |
  Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a [Sleight of Hand](/skills/sleight-of-hand/) check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to "happen" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry---if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay for these items normally.
special: |
  At the GM's option, a character can substitute the [Survival](/skills/survival/) skill for [Sleight of Hand](/skills/sleight-of-hand/) with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.
