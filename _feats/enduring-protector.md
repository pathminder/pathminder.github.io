summary: Gain temporary hit points when you reduce an opponent to 0 hit points with an attack of opportunity
flavor_text: Your determination to win grows with every foe that falls.
prerequisites:
  - Combat Reflexes
  - "[Martial Power](/feats/martial-power/)"
benefit: Whenever you reduce an opponent to 0 or fewer hit points with an attack of opportunity, you gain temporary hit points equal to that opponent's Hit Dice or the amount of temporary hit points you would normally gain when you use the [Martial Power](/feats/martial-power/) feat, whichever is higher. These temporary hit points do not stack with themselves, and last for one round.
