title: Mirror of the Moon
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Leave behind a *major image* when you use a maneuver to teleport
flavor_text: You can bend light as well as space.
prerequisites:
  - two [Shattered Mirror](/martial-disciplines/shattered-mirror/) maneuvers known
  - two [Veiled Moon](/martial-disciplines/veiled-moon/) maneuvers known
  - ability to initiate maneuvers of 4th level or higher
benefit: Whenever you initiate a maneuver that allows you to teleport, you leave behind an illusory duplicate of yourself in the space you teleport from. This duplicate functions as a *major image* spell with a caster level equal to your initiator level, except that it only lasts for one round and does not require you to concentrate to maintain or direct it. You can only create a single duplicate with this feat at any given time. This is a supernatural ability.
