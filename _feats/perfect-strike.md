  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: When wielding a monk weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - Wis 13
  - [Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)
  - base attack bonus +8
benefit: |
  You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.
special: |
  A monk may attempt a perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.
