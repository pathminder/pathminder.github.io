flavor_text: Your devotion to your principles and your allies makes acting against them unthinkable.
Prerequisite: Iron Will.
benefit: |
  Whenever you are under the effects of a charm or compulsion effect and would be compelled to take an action that violates your fundamental nature, explicitly violates the strictures of your religion, or would be an act of an alignment that directly opposes your own (for instance, a chaotic or evil act if you are lawful good), you gain a +4 bonus on any saving throw or opposed Charisma check to resist that command or break free from the effect. Whenever you are compelled to attack an ally, you take a --4 penalty on your attack rolls and damage rolls.
