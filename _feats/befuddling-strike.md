flavor_text: You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a confused stupor.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - Wis 13
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +8
benefit: |
  Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll---thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. An opponent who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
