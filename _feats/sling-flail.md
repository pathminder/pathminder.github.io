title: Sling Flail
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes.
prerequisites:
  - "[Weapon Focus](/feats/weapon-focus/) (sling)"
  - base attack bonus +1
benefit: |
  You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.
special: |
  Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.
