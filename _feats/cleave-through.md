  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.
prerequisites:
  - Str 13
  - "[Cleave](/feats/cleave/)"
  - "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"
  - base attack bonus +11
  - "[dwarf](/races/dwarves/)"
benefit: |
  When using [Cleave](/feats/cleave/) or [Great Cleave](/feats/great-cleave/), if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.
normal: |
  You may only make additional attacks with [Cleave](/feats/cleave/) against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.
