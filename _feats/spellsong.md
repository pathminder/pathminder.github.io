flavor_text: You can blend the power of your performance and spellcasting.
prerequisites:
  - Cha 13
  - bardic performance class ability
  - able to cast 1st-level spells
benefit: |
  You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways.

  First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a [Perform](/skills/perform/) check. Observers must make a [Perception](/skills/perception/) or [Sense Motive](/skills/sense-motive/) check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time.

  Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of bardic performance to maintain a bard spell with a duration of concentration. You can cast another spell in the same round you are using bardic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the bardic performance the spell is part of.
