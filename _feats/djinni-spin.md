sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can surround yourself with the power of the storm, spinning like a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy.
prerequisites:
  - Con 15
  - Wis 17
  - "[Djinni Style](/feats/djinni-style/)"
  - "[Djinni Spirit](/feats/djinni-spirit/)"
  - "[Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/)"
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th
benefit: |
  While using [Djinni Style](/feats/djinni-style/), as a standard action you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.
