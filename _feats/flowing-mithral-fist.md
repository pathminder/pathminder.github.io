sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Your unarmed strikes are treated as silver weapons, and you can sheath them for free once per round
flavor_text: You have learned how to make your unassuming hands and feet into swift moving, deadly weapons.
prerequisites:
  - Improved Unarmed Strike
  - one [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) stance known
benefit: You treat unarmed strikes as [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) discipline weapons and as silver weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction or dealing additional damage to a creature vulnerable to silver. In addition, you can sheath your hands once per round as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (even if it isn't your turn) by placing them in your pockets, under your sleeves, or in an otherwise non-threatening position.
normal: Unarmed strikes are not Mithral Current discipline weapons.
