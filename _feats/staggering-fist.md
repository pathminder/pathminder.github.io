title: Staggering Fist

sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You know just where to strike to stagger your foe.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - Wis 13
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +2
benefit: |
  When you damage a foe with your unarmed attack, you can also cause it to be staggered for 1 round (until just before your next turn). The target can avoid this with a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. You can attempt to use this feat once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
