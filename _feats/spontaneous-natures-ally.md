title: Spontaneous Nature's Ally
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: Instead of casting a cure spell, you can instead cast *summon nature's ally*.
prerequisites:
  - "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (nature) 5 ranks"
  - ability to spontaneously cast *cure* spells or *inflict* spells
  - Animal or Plant domain
benefit: |
  You can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's ally* spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a *cure* spell or an *inflict* spell as you normally would. For the purpose of this feat only, the *summon nature's ally* spells of the appropriate spell levels count as being on your spell list at the same spell level as for a druid.
