flavor_text: Your superior expertise with this weapon does not provoke attacks of opportunity from your enemies.
prerequisites:
  - "[Weapon Focus](/feats/weapon-focus/) (whip)"
  - base attack bonus +2
benefit: |
  You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a whip. You can deal lethal damage with a whip, although you can still deal nonlethal damage when you want. Further, you can deal damage with a whip despite a creature's armor bonus or natural armor bonus.
normal: |
  Attacking with a whip provokes attacks of opportunity as if you used a ranged weapon. A whip deals no damage to a creature that has an armor bonus of +1 or natural armor bonus of +3.
