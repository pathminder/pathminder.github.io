tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can feint to disengage from combat.
prerequisites:
  - Int 13
  - "[Combat Expertise](/feats/combat-expertise/)"
  - "[Improved Feint](/feats/improved-feint/)"
benefit: |
  As a standard action, use [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) to feint against an opponent. Instead of denying that opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC, a successful feint allows you to move up to your speed without provoking an attack of opportunity from the opponent you feinted for leaving the square you start in.
