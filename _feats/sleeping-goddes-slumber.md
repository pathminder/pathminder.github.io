sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Expend your psionic focus to confuse a creature you hit
flavor_text: Your attacks drag your opponent's mind into their dream world.
prerequisites:
  - "[Sleeping Goddess Style](/feats/sleeping-goddess-style/)"
  - Autohypnosis 7 ranks
benefit: Whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend your psionic focus as a free action. If you do, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your highest initiation modifier) or become *confused* for one round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by this feat for 24 hours. This is a supernatural ability.
