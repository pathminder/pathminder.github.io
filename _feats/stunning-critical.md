title: Stunning Critical
tags:
  - combat
  - critical
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
flavor_text: Your critical hits cause opponents to become stunned.
prerequisites:
  - [Critical Focus](/feats/critical-focus/)
  - [Staggering Critical](/feats/staggering-critical/)
  - base attack bonus +17
benefit: |
  Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.
special: |
  You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [Critical Mastery](/feats/critical-mastery/).
