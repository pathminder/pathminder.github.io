At the start of your turn, you decide whether or not you are going to wield the quarterstaff as a one-handed or two-handed weapon. When you wield it as a one-handed weapon, your other hand is free, and you cannot use the staff as a double weapon. You can take the feat [Weapon Specialization](/feats/weapon-specialization/) in the quarterstaff even if you have no levels in fighter.
