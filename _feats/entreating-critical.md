flavor_text: Your critical hit allows you a chance to make your foes briefly see reason.
prerequisites:
  - Cha 15
  - Call Truce
  - Critical Focus
  - Persuasive
  - base attack bonus +11
  - Diplomacy 5 ranks
benefit: |
  Whenever you confirm a critical hit, the shock of the attack momentarily opens an opportunity to end hostilities with a quick entreaty. As an immediate action immediately after confirming the critical hit, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to improve the target's attitude as though you had spent 1 full round using the Call Truce feat. All other conditions and limitations of the Call Truce feat apply.
