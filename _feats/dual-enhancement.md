title: Dual Enhancement
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
flavor_text: You can enhance two weapons, or both ends of a double weapon, with a single act.
prerequisites:
  - "[Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/two-weapon-fighting/)"
  - divine bond (weapon) or sacred weapon class feature
benefit: |
  When you use divine bond or sacred weapon to improve your weapon, you can choose to enhance two weapons or both ends of a double weapon. All weapons affected must be in hand or otherwise wielded. Any enhancement bonus you add to one of your weapons gets added to the second one at no extra cost, but weapon special abilities must be accounted for separately. For example, if you can enhance up to the equivalent of a +2 bonus, you could give both your weapons an additional +1 bonus and apply the *keen* weapon special ability to one of them.
