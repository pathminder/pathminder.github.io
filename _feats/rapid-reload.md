sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
  - - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can reload a given kind of ranged weapon quickly.
prerequisites:
  - Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](/feats/exotic-weapon-proficiency/) (firearm)
benefit: |
  Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, heavy) or a single type of one-handed or two-handed firearm that you are proficient with.

  The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity.

  If you have selected this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
normal: |
  A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm.
special: |
  You can gain [Rapid Reload](/feats/rapid-reload/) multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.
