title: Rapid Reload
tags:
  - combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
flavor_text: Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload such weapons quickly.
prerequisites:
  - Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen)
benefit: |
  The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.

  If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
normal: |
  A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.
special: |
  You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.
