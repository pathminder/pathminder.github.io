title: Sense Assumptions
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: You can easily intuit an opponent's preconceptions.
prerequisites:
  - Sense Motive 3 ranks
benefit: |
  You can attempt a Sense Motive check to intuit some of another person's assumptions after 1 minute of conversation. The DC equals 20, or 10 + the target's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, you learn whether or not a falsehood of your choice related to the topic of conversation would impose a penalty on Bluff checks to convince the target of that falsehood's truth. If you fail by 4 or less, you learn nothing. If you fail by 5 or more, the target realizes you are trying to glean information from it. You can retry this check, but the DC increases by 5 for each previous failure on this check against that target.
