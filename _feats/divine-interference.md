title: Divine Interference
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack.
prerequisites:
  - divine spellcaster
  - caster level 10th
benefit: |
  As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.
