  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
flavor_text: Your feverish and sometimes comical defensive techniques offer enough distraction to aid allies.
prerequisites:
  - "[Cautious Fighter](/feats/cautious-fighter/)"
  - "[halfling](/races/halflings/)"
benefit: |
  Whenever you fight defensively or use the total defense action, allies gain a luck bonus to AC and CMD equal to 1/2 the dodge bonus you gain from the action you are taking. Allies only gain this bonus while they are adjacent to you.
