title: Gorgon's Fist
tags:
  - combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
flavor_text: With one well-placed blow, you leave your target reeling.
prerequisites:
  - [Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)
  - [Scorpion Style](/feats/scorpion-style/)
  - base attack bonus +6
benefit: |
  As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from [Scorpion Style](/feats/scorpion-style/)). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.
