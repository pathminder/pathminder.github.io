title: Owl Dive
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: Your martial training helps you fly and charge through others' spaces.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 17
  - Owl Style
  - Owl Swoop
  - Skill Focus (Stealth)
  - base attack bonus +7 or monk level 5th
  - Acrobatics 1 rank
  - Fly 1 rank
  - Stealth 1 rank
benefit: |
  While using Owl Style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Fly to determine your Fly skill bonus. You can charge through other creatures' spaces, but you must make a successful Acrobatics check to move through enemy spaces, as normal. If you fail an Acrobatics check to move through an enemy's space during a charge, your charge stops just before you enter that enemy's space; if you threaten that foe, you can make your charge attack against that foe.
