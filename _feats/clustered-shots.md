flavor_text: You take a moment to carefully aim your shots, causing them all to strike nearly the same spot.
prerequisites:
  - "[Point-Blank Shot](/feats/point-blank-shot/)"
  - "[Precise Shot](/feats/precise-shot/)"
  - base attack bonus +6
benefit: |
  When you use a full-attack action to make multiple ranged weapon attacks against the same opponent, total the damage from all hits before applying that opponent's damage reduction.
special: |
  If the massive damage optional rule is being used (*Core Rulebook* 189), that rule applies if the total damage you deal with this feat is equal to or exceeds half the opponent's full normal hit points (minimum 50 points of damage).
