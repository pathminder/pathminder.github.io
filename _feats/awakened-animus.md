summary: You can spend animus on power point augments
flavor_text: You can modulate the roiling energies within your soul with mental might.
prerequisites:
  - animus pool or equivalent ability (such as a rubato bard's tempo class feature or the [Tap Animus](/feats/tap-animus) feat)
benefit: When initiating maneuvers with a psionic augment, you may spend points of animus as if they were power points. In addition, you gain a reserve of 1 power point and the psionic subtype, allowing you to take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats and to gain psionic focus.
