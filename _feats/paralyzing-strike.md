flavor_text: Finding just the right pressure point, you paralyze your foe with a single hit.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 13
  - Wis 13
  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - base attack bonus +14
benefit: |
  You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Paralyzing Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. An opponent who fails this saving throw is paralyzed for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Paralyzing Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
