title: Heroic Recovery
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: You can throw off the effects of crippling conditions.
prerequisites:
  - "[Diehard](/feats/diehard/)"
  - "[Endurance](/feats/endurance/)"
  - base Fortitude save +4
benefit: |
  Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition or affliction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you. If this save against the affliction fails, there is no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing an affliction such as poison or disease. You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save.
