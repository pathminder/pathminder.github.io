title: Deadly Pairing
sources:
  - Path of War
tags:
  - Teamwork
summary: Increase threat modifier when flanking
flavor_text: Through working together, you and an ally are capable of striking vital locations.
prerequisites:
  - deadly strike +1d6
  - at least one [Steel Serpent](/martial-disciplines/steel-serpent/) stance known.
benefit: Whenever you and another ally flank a creature both you and that ally increase the critical threat range of your weapons by 1 (so a weapon with a 19--20 threat range would increase to 18-20) if you or your ally are in a stance from the [Steel Serpent](/martial-disciplines/steel-serpent/) discipline. This additional critical threat range is not multiplied by abilities such as keen or the Improved Critical feat and is applied after abilities such as those are applied.
