title: Pass For Human
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own race.
prerequisites:
  - half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special)
benefit: |
  You receive a +10 bonus on [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.
special: |
  A halfling may take this feat, but must have the [Childlike](/feats/childlike/) feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.
