title: Scarlet Throne Style
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
  - Style
summary: Treat one-handed weapons as two-handed weapons for the purposes of class features and feats
flavor_text: Your skill with a single blade allows you to strike with the same force as those much stronger than you.
prerequisites:
  - Sense Motive 3 ranks
  - one [Scarlet Throne](/martial-disciplines/scarlet-throne/) stance known
benefit: As long as you only attack with a single weapon wielded in one hand during a round, you treat that weapon as if you were wielding it in two hands for the purposes of feats and abilities that would benefit from this change. This does not increase your Strength bonus to damage with the weapon.
special: Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes.
