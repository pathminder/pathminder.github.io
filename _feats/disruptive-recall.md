title: Disruptive Recall
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
flavor_text: You can disrupt an enemy caster's spells to fuel your own arcane power.
prerequisites:
  - spell recall class feature
  - "[Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/) 5 ranks"
benefit: |
  When you use a melee attack to successfully disrupt an arcane spellcaster's spell, you can immediately use your spell recall class feature to regain a magus spell you have already cast. This ability functions as if you had expended a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the level of the spell you disrupted, up to the maximum level spell you can cast.
