title: Cutting Humiliation
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: You know how to cut a foe deeply with humiliation.
prerequisites:
  - Persuasive
  - Intimidate 5 ranks
benefit: |
  When you successfully demoralize a target by
using a verbal Intimidate check in a social situation (rather than an Intimidate check you can make via an ability such as Dazzling Display or Enforcer), you can instead humiliate the target, causing it to take a --2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks and Charisma ability checks for 1 hour + 1 additional hour for every 5 by which the result of your check exceeds the DC. The target can remove the effect early by taking 10 minutes to compose herself. If you fail this check, any creature who witnessed the failure is immune to your humiliation from this feat for 24 hours. If you fail by 5 or more, you become humiliated for 1 hour instead of your target.
