title: Lurker in Darkness
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
summary: Use Stealth to hide from unusual senses
flavor_text: Your training allows you to foil even magical and unusual senses.
prerequisites:
  - Stealth 6 ranks
benefit: Creatures using unusual forms of sensory perception such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense cannot automatically foil your use of Stealth; such creatures must make a Perception check as normal to detect you when you make use of the Stealth skill. This feat foils indirect detection (such as a creature using *detect magic* to search for your magical items while you are using Stealth) in the manner described above, but has no effect on psi-like abilities, powers, spells, spell-like abilities, and/or supernatural abilities specifically used to uncover information about you rather than enhancing the user's perception, such as the *augury* spell.
