flavor_text: Your spells have the maximum possible effect.
benefit: |
  All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

  An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus half the normally rolled result.
