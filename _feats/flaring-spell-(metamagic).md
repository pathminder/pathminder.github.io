title: Flaring Spell (Metamagic)
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You dazzle creatures when you affect them with a spell that has the fire, light, or electricity descriptor.
benefit: |
  The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell. A flare spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor.

  A flaring spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
