title: Stunning Irruption
sources:

tags:
  - Combat
flavor_text: When you smash your way into a room, you gain more than just the element of surprise.
prerequisites:
  - Str 15
  - Power Attack
  - base attack bonus +5
benefit: |
  Before starting combat, you can attempt to break through a door, window, or wall to enter a room. If you succeed, the violence of your arrival is so great that all characters within 20 feet of your entry point must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be stunned instead of acting in the surprise round (if there is one) plus 1 round thereafter. Characters who succeed at this save are instead shaken for 1d4 rounds.
