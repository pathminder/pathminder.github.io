title: Crossbow Mastery
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide
flavor_text: You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 15
  - "[Point-Blank Shot](/feats/point-blank-shot/)"
  - "[Rapid Reload](/feats/rapid-reload/)"
  - "[Rapid Shot](/feats/rapid-shot/)"
benefit: |
  The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took [Rapid Reload](/feats/rapid-reload/) no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.
special: |
  Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select [Crossbow Mastery](/feats/crossbow-mastery/) as a combat style feat.
