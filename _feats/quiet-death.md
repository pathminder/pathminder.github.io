title: Quiet Death
tags:
  - Combat
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue
flavor_text: You have learned to dispatch your enemies with the silence and grace of an accomplished assassin.
prerequisites:
  - Dex 19
  - Stealth 10 ranks
  - rogue level 10th
benefit: |
  When you ambush an enemy or enemies that are unaware of your presence, you can roll a Stealth check with a --5 penalty. The result indicates the Perception DC to hear your attacks (rather than the normal DC of --10 to hear pitched combat) until an opponent's first action, when the DC returns to --10. Other enemies present can still see the attack; Quiet Death only prevents the sounds of battle from alerting further enemies.
