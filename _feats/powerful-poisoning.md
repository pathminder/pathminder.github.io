title: Powerful Poisoning
sources:
  - "Pathfinder Player Companion: Dirty Tactics Toolbox"
flavor_text: You can make powerful attacks that place more of your weapon's poison into a target's wounds.
prerequisites:
  - "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"
  - Craft (poison) 3 ranks or poison use class feature
benefit: |
  When you damage an opponent with a [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) while using a poisoned weapon, you can forgo the bonus damage from [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) to increase the save DC of the poison by 1. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the bonus to the poison's save DC increases by an additional 1. This can't cause the save DC to exceed 15 + 1/2 your character level.
