  - "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  - "[Boar Ferocity](/feats/boar-ferocity/)"

benefit: |
  You can make an [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. While using [Boar Style](/feats/boar-style/), whenever you tear an opponent's flesh, once per round at the start of that opponent's turn he takes 1d6 bleed damage. The bleed damage dealt while using [Boar Style](/feats/boar-style/) persists even if you later switch to a different style.
