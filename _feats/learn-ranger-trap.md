title: Learn Ranger Trap
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You learn how to create one kind of ranger trap.
prerequisites:
  - "[Survival](/skills/survival/) 5 ranks"
benefit: |
  Select one ranger trap. You may use this trap a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for your trap is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character's level + your Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per two character levels.

  If you are not a ranger, you can only set extraordinary traps with this feat; like all extraordinary ranger traps, this decreases the trap DC by 2.

  A ranger may use ranger traps a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level plus his Wisdom bonus. See the description of ranger traps for durations.
