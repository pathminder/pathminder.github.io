title: Eldritch Heritage
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
flavor_text: You are descended from a long line of sorcerers, and some portion of their power flows in your veins.
prerequisites:
  - Cha 13
  - "[Skill Focus](/feats/skill-focus/) with the class skill of bloodline selected for this feat (see below)"
  - character level 3rd
benefit: |
  Select one sorcerer bloodline. You must have Skill focus in the class skill that bloodline grants to a sorcerer at 1st level (for example, [Heal](/skills/heal/) for the celestial bloodline). This bloodline cannot be a bloodline you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline. For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character level -- 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.
