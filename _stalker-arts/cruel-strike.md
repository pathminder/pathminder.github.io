When the brutal slayer hits with a melee attack while under the effect of his brutal strikes ability, he can reduce the damage he deals by 1/4 (rounded down) to sicken the target for a number of rounds equal to his brutal slayer initiation modifier.

The stalker must have the brutal strikes class feature to select this stalker art.
