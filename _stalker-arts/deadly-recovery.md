The stalker's deadly nature is reflected when he is considered to be most vulnerable. While recovering maneuvers as a full round action, the stalker gains the use of the Combat Reflexes feat (using his Wisdom modifier in place of his Dexterity modifier). He may also add his deadly strike damage to any attacks of opportunity he makes while he is recovering maneuvers.
