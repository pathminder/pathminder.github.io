Some stalkers have learned techniques that are similar to those of the rogue, and may select chained [rogue talents](/rogue-talents/) instead of stalker arts. Stalkers may not learn advanced talents, nor can they gain the *ki* pool or underhanded rogue talents. Talents that apply to a rogue's sneak attack apply to a stalker's deadly strike ability.
