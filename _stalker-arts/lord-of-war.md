The stalker adds [Scarlet Throne](/martial-disciplines/scarlet-throne/) or [Piercing Thunder](/martial-disciplines/piercing-thunder/) his list of available disciplines. If he does not have that discipline's associated skill as a class skill, he gains it as a class skill. In addition, he gains a +2 competence bonus on checks with that skill. A stalker may select this stalker art once for each discipline.
