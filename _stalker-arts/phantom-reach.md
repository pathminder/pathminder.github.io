The stalker is capable of extending the reach of melee range martial strikes by infusing *ki* into the maneuver, causing a phantom echo to rush towards the enemy and initiate the attack. As a swift action, the stalker may spend one *ki* point and initiate a melee martial strike with a range of melee attack as if it instead had a range of close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Strikes with a range greater than melee attack do not function with this art.
