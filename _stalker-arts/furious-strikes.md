The Strength bonus granted by the brutal slayer's brutal strikes ability increases by +2. In addition, he treats his class level as his base attack bonus for the purposes of qualifying for critical feats. If the brutal slayer possesses fighter levels, he also adds his brutal slayer level to his fighter level for the purposes of qualifying for critical feats.

The stalker must have the brutal strikes class feature to select this stalker art.
