The stalker knows how to maintain a quiet, innocuous attitude as if he were nothing more than a part of the scenery. The stalker spends a point of *ki* as a full round action to activate his obfuscation, and as long as he remains in a non- threatening posture (by carrying no weapons in hand and moving at half his base speed) the stalker radiates a psychic field that causes others to ignore his presence for a number of minutes equal to the stalker's Wisdom modifier. Subjects who normally would react to the stalker's presence in a way that would stop or harm him must make a Will save (DC 15 + the stalker's Wisdom modifier) or be under the influence of the cloud mind psionic power. For every 2 additional points of *ki* spent on this art, the saving throw DC increases by +1 to a maximum of the stalker's Wisdom modifier.
