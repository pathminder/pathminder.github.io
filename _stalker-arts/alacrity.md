A stalker's land speed is faster than the norm for his race, gaining a +10 ft. enhancement bonus to his base speed and he may add his Wisdom modifier to Acrobatics checks, due to his nimble and finely honed body. The stalker enjoys this benefit only when he is wearing no armor or light armor, not using a shield, and not carrying a medium or heavy load.

As a swift action, the character may spend a point of *ki* to pour extra speed to his step to increase this bonus from 10 ft. to an additional 30 ft. for one minute, but he is fatigued afterward for 1d4 minutes as he catches his breath.
