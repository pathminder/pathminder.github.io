A judge with this potent art can bring deadly judgment to foes that are unaware of their impending doom. To attempt to levy final judgment on a target, the judge must first study his target for three full rounds before making the final judgment. On the following round, if the judge initiates a maneuver against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the maneuver has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the judge as an enemy. If the attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the judge's level + the judge's Wisdom modifier. If the save is successful, the target still suffers the effects of the maneuver as normal, but it is immune to that judge's final judgment ability for 1 day.

The character must have the judgment class feature from the stalker class to select this stalker art.
