Like the flashing rapids, thundering waterfalls and deep, silent depths of the ocean, Disciples of Mithral Current embody the many forms and ever changing nature of water. The art of Mithral Current's bladework began as a set of scattered abilities found across several different island nations. Through frequent cultural exchange, trade and war these techniques spread and mixed forming a unique style that blended the culture and history of many peoples. The discipline found its use among all walks of life, from noble palaces where the drawing of a blade was an act of social suicide to the slums of portside cities where a hidden blade was the only thing that could keep one safe.

**Associated Skill:** Perform (dance).
