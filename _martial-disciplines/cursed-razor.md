The discipline known now as Cursed Razor has dark origins indeed, spawned forth from the bodyguards of an ancient demonic cult. Tapping into the power of their own malevolence, these warrior-warlocks struck their opponents down with dark curses channeled through their weapons and developed techniques to project maleficent auras that sapped away at the bodies and minds of their enemies. Since then Cursed Razor has spread far beyond the now-dead cult, which taught other students before its demise, left books of its secrets lying around, or else simply inspired others with demonstrations of its entropic power. Though the techniques of Cursed Razor stem from the inborn malice found in any sapient mind, its powers are not necessarily evil---pragmatic, certainly, and utterly lacking in any sense of fair play, but not evil. Knights and champions in the mortal realm seeking the weapons to combat evil turn to Cursed Razor to gain an edge on their fiendish foes, or as a way of acknowledging the terrible truth of evil's place in the multiverse while at the same time casting their defiance in its teeth.
