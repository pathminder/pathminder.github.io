The Piercing Thunder discipline finds its traditions rooted in one of the oldest weapons known to intelligent beings: the spear. Be this spear fought in melee, tossed to hunt, or used as part of a charge, the spear, and later the pole arm, has been a standard in military practice. Those who following Piercing Thunder's teachings know that these mighty hafted weapons are equally at home in the hands of a strong warrior on the battlefield or even in the hands of a poor peasant militia---the spear knows no rank, only skill. Piercing Thunder shows superiority through overwhelming force through reach and mobility.
