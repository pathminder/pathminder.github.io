The discipline known as Thrashing Dragon has a long standing tradition amongst both ascetics and daredevils alike, as its movements and style fit both the dedication and tenacity of more disciplined fighters, as well as the erratic and improvisational style of free spirited warriors. Practitioners of the style are often lithe and nimble, graceful and quick, as the style demands speed and the ability to correct one's movements fluidly. Thrashing Dragon is a demanding style that requires both agility and athletic ability. Its disciples are primarily two-weapon fighters, skilled with weapons that are used for quick slashes and stabs. It is an acrobatic style, using the disciple's natural speed and grace to avoid blows as opposed to blocking them with their smaller weapons.

Many Thrashing Dragon maneuvers require that its practitioner be wielding two weapons (one in each hand or one weapon and unarmed strike), wielding a double weapon, using natural weapons, or be unarmed to utilize them.

**Associated Skill:** Acrobatics.
