Disciples of the Silver Crane are men and women for whom the power of the celestial and divine flow into the arts of their blade. The Silver Crane is a goodly discipline and may only be learned and used by those who have a good alignment who are inspired by the teachings of good aligned outsiders. It focuses on strong strikes designed to combat evil, celestial insights, and combat-predictions to defeat foes and enable the initiator and his allies to endure the hardships of battle against the forces of evil. Upon learning the art of Silver Crane, the disciple becomes in tune with the flows of the celestial realm, gaining heavenly insights into combat as if the angels themselves were granting insight to the warrior in battle.

Maneuvers and stances from this discipline are supernatural abilities unless otherwise noted. All abilities in this discipline also carry the [Good] descriptor unless otherwise noted.
