Though some put their trust in a well-crafted sword or a solid shield, the greatest warriors know that a tempered mind and devotion to one's ideals are the sharpest weapon and the toughest armor. A Sleeping Goddess adept strikes his deathblow not at the heart of his foe, but at the ideals and principles he devotes himself to, undermining his conceptual basis of reality. Through their mastery of psionics and overpowering force of belief, disciples of this discipline assert their presence on the world, transcending the shackles of reality and making their surroundings their own. A master of the discipline becomes unto a god, rending minds asunder as easily as bodies, and shaking the foundations of others' beliefs merely by sharing their own.

The Sleeping Goddess discipline unlocks the power of the mind, allowing its adepts to tap into their psionic talent. You gain power points equal to the highest level Sleeping Goddess maneuver you know (including stances), plus one additional power point for each Sleeping Goddess maneuver known beyond the first (including stances). If you already have a power point pool, you add those points to it. If you do not have a power point pool, you gain one as well as the psionic subtype. You do not gain bonus power points for a high initiation modifier (though you do gain bonus power points for having a high key ability score if you have levels in a manifester class, as normal).

**Associated Skill:** Autohypnosis.

**Associated Weapon Groups:** Flails, heavy blades, monk, and spears. In addition, any weapon created by the form mind blade class feature or equivalent ability (such as a deadly fist's empowered strikes, a psychic armory's panoply of blades, or a soulbolt's mind bolt) or by a Sleeping Goddess maneuver is treated as a discipline weapon.
