With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can't ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).

Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions' future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.

Once a corpse has been subject to *grave words* by any caster, any new attempt to cast *grave words* on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn't affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.
