You create 1d4+2 wood golems with the advanced template. The golems willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. You can only have one *wooden phalanx* spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.
