This spell functions as [*interposing hand*](/spells/interposing-hand/), except that it can also grapple one opponent as [*grasping hand*](/spells/grasping-hand/). Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A *crushing hand* deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The *crushing hand* can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as [*forceful hand*](/spells/forceful-hand/)), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as *interposing hand* does.
