A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the palm of your hand. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. A creature hit by this spell is wracked by painful spasms as its muscles and sinews wither and twist. The subject takes 1d4 points of Dexterity and Strength damage per 3 caster levels you possess (maximum 5d4 each). This spell cannot reduce an ability score below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.
