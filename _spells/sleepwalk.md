You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains helpless for all other purposes. The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While *sleepwalk* allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement.
