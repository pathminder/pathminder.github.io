*Brand* etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6 characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. A *brand* can be hidden by clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of damage), though the *brand* returns if the damage is healed.
