Using worlds of ancient power, you bestow heroic powers on all creatures subject to this spell. They gain a +4 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls, gain 2d8+4 temporary hit points, and become immune to both fear and charm effects for the spell's duration.

At the end of the spell's duration, the subjects become fatigued.
