When you cast this spell, lightning spills forth from your body in all directions. The bolts do not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the area you [*wish*](/spells/wish/) to exclude from damage. Any other creatures within the area take 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun effect.
