You automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within 60 feet, as if you possessed the blindsight ability. *Nondetection*, *mind blank*, and similar effects can block this effect. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and non-sentient (Intelligence 1--2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects.
