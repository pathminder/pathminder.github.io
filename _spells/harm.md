*Harm* charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, *harm* deals half this amount. *Harm* cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.

If used on an undead creature, *harm* acts like [*heal*](/spells/harm/).
