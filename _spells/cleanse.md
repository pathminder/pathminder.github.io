Positive energy infuses and cleanses your body. This spell cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) and ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting you: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, *cleanse* functions as [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/) upon a single additional effect of your choice that is affecting you and that can be legally affected by this effect.

If used by undead or other creatures healed by negative energy, the spell cleanses with negative energy rather than positive.
