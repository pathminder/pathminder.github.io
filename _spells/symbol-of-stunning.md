This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that all creatures within 60 feet of a *symbol of stunning* instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.

*Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of stunning* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for *symbol of stunning*.
