This spell functions as [*resurrection*](/spells/resurrection/) except that instead of recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the advanced simple template to possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject's spell resistance, the subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as *resurrection*) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions as [*possession*](/spells/possession/) except that the subject's soul is not present to resist. When *false resurrection* ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as *resurrection*). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.

Attempts to identify *false resurrection* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*resurrection*](/spells/ressurection/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse/) descriptor. A fooled viewer mistakes *false resurrection*'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.
