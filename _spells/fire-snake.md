You create a sinuous line of flames that you may shape as desired. The *fire snake* affects one 5-foot square per caster level, and each square must be adjacent to the previous square, starting with you. The *fire snake* may not extend beyond its maximum range. Creatures in the path of the *fire snake* take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).
