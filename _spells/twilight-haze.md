You create a gray haze that obscures sight (as [*fog cloud*](/spells/fog-cloud/)) and causes the illumination level within it to dim by one step (as per [*darkness*](/spells/darkness/)). Since this spell produces an illusion rather than a true physical fog, it is unaffected by wind and can be cast underwater.
