This spell functions as [*teleport*](/spells/teleport/), except you use it to teleport yourself or one other creature to a safe location you specify (the target can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed the target's heavy load). You can only send the target to a location with which you are very familiar. The target is first trapped in ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch thick per caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed, aware but unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as the teleportation aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4 rounds, the target teleports to the specified location, and the ice's hit points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away. If the ice is destroyed before the target teleports, the spell ends and the teleport doesn't occur.
