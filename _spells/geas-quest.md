This spell functions similarly to [*lesser geas*](/spells/lesser-geas/), except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas/quest for 24 hours, it takes a --3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another --3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of --12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *geas/quest*.

A [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/) spell ends a *geas/quest* spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/) does not end a *geas/quest*, but [*limited [*wish*](/spells/wish/)*](/spells/limited-wish/), [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/), and [*wish*](/spells/wish/) do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as *geas*, while clerics call the same spell *quest*.
