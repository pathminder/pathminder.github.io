The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict movement, including [*binding*](/spells/binding/), [*entangle*](/spells/entangle/), grappling, [*imprisonment*](/spells/imprisonment/), [*maze*](/spells/imprisonment/), paralysis, petrification, pinning, [*sleep*], [*slow*](/spells/slow/), stunning, [*temporal stasis*](/spells/temporal-stasis/), and [*web*](/spells/web/). To free a creature from *imprisonment* or *maze*, you must know its name and background, and you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or banished into the maze.
