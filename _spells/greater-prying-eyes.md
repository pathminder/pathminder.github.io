This spell functions like [*prying eyes*](/spells/prying-eyes/), except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had [*true seeing*](/spells/true-seeing/) with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a greater prying eye's maximum [Perception](/skills/perception/) modifier is +25 instead of +15.
