You grant the target a dodge bonus to its Armor Class against attacks from larger creatures. The bonus is equal to +1 for every size category the attacker is larger than the target of the spell, to a maximum of +1 per 3 caster levels. If the spell's target is a gnome, the maximum bonus is equal to +1 per 2 caster levels.
