This spell functions as [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except all creatures within 60 feet are affected with uncontrollable laughter (as [*hideous laughter*](/spells/hideous-laughter/)) for 1 round per caster level.

Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of laughter* has no hit point limit; once it is triggered, a *symbol of laughter* remains active for 1 minute per caster level.

*Symbol of laughter* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell by a caster of 10th level or higher at a cost of 5,000 gp.
