This spell functions as [*heroism*](/spells/heroism/), except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save).

Attempts to identify *hollow heroism* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*heroism*](/spells/heroism/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse) descriptor.
