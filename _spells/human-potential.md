The target shares in humanity's great potential as encouraged by Last Emperor. The target chooses one ability score and gains a +2 enhancement bonus to that ability score. The bonus confers the usual benefit to skills and abilities based on the ability enhanced, but does not affect bonus spells or skill ranks.
