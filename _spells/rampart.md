You create a massive *rampart* of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The *rampart* cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the *rampart* has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the *rampart* whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the *rampart* with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the *rampart* with a DC 20 Climb check.
