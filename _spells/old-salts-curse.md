You inflict a curse of the roiling sea upon the target, making it permanently sickened. Anytime the target is on or in the water more than a mile from shore, it also becomes staggered with seasickness. This curse cannot be dispelled, though [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/) or [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/) can negate it.
