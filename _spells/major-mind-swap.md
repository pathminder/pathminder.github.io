The spell functions as [*mind swap*](/spells/mind-swap/), except as noted above. In addition, after 24 hours, instead of using each other's hit points, you each revert to your original hit points, modified by your new Constitution modifiers. This spell can be reversed only with *miracle*, *wish*, or another *major mind swap*.
