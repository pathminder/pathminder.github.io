You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the item's history, or the information imprinted by the [*charge object*](/spells/charge/object/) or [*implant false reading*](/spells/implant-false-reading/) spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock for [Appraise](/skills/appraise/), but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.
