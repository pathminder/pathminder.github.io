You mend the target's injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as [*cure serious wounds*](/spells/cure-serious-wounds/), but leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as cure serious wounds) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round's damage and end the affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed.

[*Detect poison*](/spells/detect-poison/) reveals an inert *poisonous balm* only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level. Attempts to identify poisonous balm with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*cure serious wounds*](/spells/cure-serious-wounds/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse) descriptor. A fooled viewer mistakes *poisonous balm*'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous effect.
