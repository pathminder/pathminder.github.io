You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature's ki. This replenishes 1 point of *ki* as long as you have at least 1 *ki* point in your *ki* pool. This does not allow you to exceed your *ki* pool's maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal *ki* ability of the hungry ghost monk). This spell has no effect if you do not have a *ki8 pool.
