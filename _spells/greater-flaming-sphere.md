This spell functions as [*flaming sphere*](/spells/flaming-sphere/), except it deals 6d6 points of fire damage to any creature it strikes. Any creature that fails its save against the sphere catches on fire. If a creature catches on fire, the DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the DC of this spell.
