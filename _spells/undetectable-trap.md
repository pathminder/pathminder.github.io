You shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more difficult to locate. Spells like [*detect magic*](/spells/detect-magic/) can't locate any magic aura from either the target trap or from undetectable trap. Furthermore, a character under the effect of the [*find traps*](/spells/find-trap/) spell doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from *find traps* doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add 1/2 your caster level to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception checks.

A ranger with the ranger traps class feature can cast this spell on a ranger trap he creates as part of the same action he uses to prepare a ranger trap. This doesn't reduce the spell's casting time if such a ranger casts this spell on an ordinary trap, even one that he created himself using Craft (traps).
