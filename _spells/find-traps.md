You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You gain an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect. You receive a check to notice traps within 10 feet of you, even if you are not actively searching for them. Note that *find traps* grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.
