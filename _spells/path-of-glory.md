You cause four 5-foot squares (one of which must be your space) to glow with dim illumination. Starting on your next turn, as a swift action you can extend the glowing area by an additional four 5-foot squares; each new square must be adjacent to a square that was previously glowing. Allies who end their turns on a glowing square (including those who fall unconscious in the square) are healed of 1 point of damage.
