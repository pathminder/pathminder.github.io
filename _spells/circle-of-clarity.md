You create a magical emanation that interferes with all figments and glamers within it, giving creatures a +4 bonus on saving throws to recognize them as illusions. The emanation negates concealment less than total concealment within the area. [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks to notice creatures or objects within the area gain a bonus equal to half your caster level (maximum +10). The spell is stationary if cast on a point in space. It is mobile if centered on a creature or object, though creatures or attended objects can negate the spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.
