You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you succeed at a save against an enchantment effect, you identify the effect as if you had succeeded at a [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/) check to do so. Furthermore, you can choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks to convince others that you failed your save and are under the enchantment's effects. A creature that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so.
