This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A [*knock*](/spells/knock/) spell or a successful [*dispel magic*](/spells/dispel-magic/) spell can negate a *hold portal* spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.
