You make yourself---including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment---appear translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the king or a sahuagin, you look like a ghostly version of the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance.


The spell does not actually make you ghostly or provide any incorporeal abilities. If you choose, the illusion can make you appear to float slightly above the ground, though you are actually still on the ground. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
