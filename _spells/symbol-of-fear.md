This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that all creatures within 60 feet of the *symbol of fear* instead become panicked for 1 round per caster level.

*Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of fear* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for *symbol of fear*.
