Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, *hunter's eye* greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the [*see invisibility*](/spells/see-invisibility/) spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, [*blur*](/spells/blur/), [*displacement*](/spells/displacement/), [*invisibility*](/spells/invisibility/), and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.
