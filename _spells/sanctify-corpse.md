This spell blesses a corpse with positive energy, preventing it from being turned into an undead creature. Attempts to raise the corpse as an undead automatically fail. If the corpse is of a person slain by a creature that creates undead out of its slain foes (such as a shadow, vampire, or wraith), that effect is delayed until the end of this spell. It is possible to protect a corpse for an extended time by casting this spell each day.

*Sanctify corpse* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell by a caster of 9th level or higher for the cost of 500 gp.
