You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. Ageless or immortal creatures are immune to this spell.

If you cast this on an object, construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as time weathers and corrodes it. This version of the spell has an instantaneous duration.
