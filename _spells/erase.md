*Erase* removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove [*explosive runes*](/spells/explosive-runes/), a [*glyph of warding*](/spells/glyph-of-warding/), a [*sepia snake sigil*](/spells/sepia-snake-sigil/), or an [*arcane mark*](/spells/arcane-mark/), but not [*illusory script*](/spells/illusory-script/) or a *symbol* spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase *explosive runes*, a 8glyph of warding*, or a *sepia snake sigil*, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
