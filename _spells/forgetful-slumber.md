This spell acts as the [*deeper slumber*](/spells/deeper-slumber/) spell, but affects only one creature of 10 Hit Dice or fewer. In addition, a creature affected by this spell awakens with no knowledge of the events that led to the spell's casting. The target loses all memory from the 5 minutes prior to falling asleep. No effect short of a [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/) or [*wish*](/spells/wish/) can restore memories lost by this spell.
