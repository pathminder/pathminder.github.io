With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target's flesh. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. *Fleshworm infestation* cannot be ended early by remove disease or heal, as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. [*Protection from evil*](/spells/protection-from-evil/) negates this spell's effects for as long as the two durations overlap. [*Dispel evil*](/spells/dispel-evil/) automatically ends a *fleshworm infestation*.
