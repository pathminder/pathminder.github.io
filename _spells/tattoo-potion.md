When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of your choice. Once you finish casting *tattoo potion*, the potion begins bubbling and fizzing---if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is destroyed.

When a potion under the effects of tattoo potion is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion transforms into a [*spell tattoo*](/magic-items/spell-tattoo/) on the drinker's chest tattoo slot---if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location, the *tattoo potion* is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo*, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a *spell tattoo*.
