You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from returning. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the dead creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level. *Rest eternal* cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated with [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/) or [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/).
