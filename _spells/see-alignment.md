When you cast this spell, select a single alignment (such as lawful good or chaotic evil). Creatures of that alignment glow with a ghostly radiance while they are within your vision. Though you can see this radiance, other creatures cannot.

Spells and effects that obscure alignment, like [*undetectable alignment*](/spells/undetectable-alignment/), also obscure the effects of this spell.
