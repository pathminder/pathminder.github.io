This spell functions like [*magic siege weapon*](/spells/magic-siege-weapon/), except it gives an indirect fire siege weapon an enhancement bonus on targeting and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

If used on a direct-fire siege weapon, this spell functions as [*greater magic weapon*](/spells/greater-magic-weapon/).
