You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a [*slow*](/spells/slow/) spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as [*create water*](/spells/create-water/) or [*hydraulic push*](/spells/hydraulic-push/)) removes all the mud in 1 round.

A [*haste*](/spells/haste/) effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the haste. *Slow* does not stack with the effects of *slowing mud*. This spell cannot counter or dispel *haste*.
