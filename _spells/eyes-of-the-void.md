You gain the ability to see 60 feet in total darkness, including that created by [*deeper darkness*](/spells/deeper-darkness/). This vision is black-and-white only, but otherwise like normal sight. While affected, your eyes turn completely black (but appear white to anyone viewing you with darkvision).
