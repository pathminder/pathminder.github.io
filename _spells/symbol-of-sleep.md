This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the *symbol of sleep* instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the [*sleep*](/spells/sleep/) spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of sleep* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of sleep* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of sleep* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of sleep*.
