This spell functions like [*gaseous form*](/spells/gaseous-form/), except the target's vaporous body is dangerous to creatures that touch it. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Intelligence modifier) on its turn to resist the vapors. When you cast this spell, you select one of the following options.

*Stinking cloud:* The target's body nauseates creatures that fail their saving throws, as [*stinking cloud*](/spells/stinking-cloud/) (Fortitude negates, see text). This form of the spell does not require a material component.

*Poisonous cloud:* The target's body is deadly poison, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to creatures that fail their saves (Fortitude halves). This form of the spell requires a material component.
