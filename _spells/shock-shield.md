This spell creates an invisible shield similar to but not as strong as the [*shield*](/spells/shield/) spell. This shield hovers in front of you and negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk provides a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.

At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss your shield, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
