A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A [*fireball*](/spells/fireball/), [*flame strike*](/spells/flame-strike/), or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A [*wall of fire*](/spells/wall-of-fire/) burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.
