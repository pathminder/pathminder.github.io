The warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC against firearm and ranged attacks, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every five caster levels you have (to a maximum of +8 at 20th level). Though the spell is called *bullet shield*, it also grants this protection from attacks made from firearms with the scatter weapon quality.
