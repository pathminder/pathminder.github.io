The subject temporarily ceases to feel the ill effects of a single ongoing affliction or condition from the following list: blinded, cursed, dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, poisoned, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. If that affliction or condition has a duration, it is suspended until this spell expires. If the subject has multiple instances of the same type of affliction (such as multiple diseases), a single casting of this spell can suspend only one of them. *Placebo effect* doesn't remove or temporarily negate any damage that the affliction may have already caused, nor does it provide protection against receiving such conditions again.
