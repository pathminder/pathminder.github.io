This spell functions as [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as [*mirror image*](/spells/mirror-image/), moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Symbol of mirroring* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
