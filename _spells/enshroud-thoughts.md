You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the effects of divination spells such as *detect thoughts* and *seek thoughts*, as well as enchantment spells such as *modify memory* and *memory lapse* . If another creature attempts to target you with a mind-affecting spell that detects or alters your thoughts or memories, the caster must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level or the spell fails. Only spells that detect or alter your thoughts or memories are blocked by this spell; effects such as *clairaudience/clairvoyance*, *detect evil*, and *locate creature* continue to affect you as normal.
