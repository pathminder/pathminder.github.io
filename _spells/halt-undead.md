This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of [*hold person*](/spells/hold-person/) on a living creature). The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.
