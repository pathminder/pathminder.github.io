You strengthen the bond between your divine bond weapon and its celestial spirit. The weapon gains the *ghost touch* property. You may change your weapon's damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing) as a swift action. You gain a sacred bonus to your CMD against disarm and sunder attacks directed at your bonded weapon; this bonus is equal to half your caster level.
