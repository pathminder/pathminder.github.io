This spell functions as [*teleport*](/spells/teleport/) except that you can opt to intentionally cause any number of the creatures traveling with you to suffer a mishap or arrive in a specific different location you visualize simultaneously with the original destination, or both.

Attempts to identify treacherous teleport with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*teleport*](/spells/teleport/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse) descriptor.
