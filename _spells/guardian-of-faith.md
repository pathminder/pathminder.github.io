The target gains the benefit of [*shield of faith*](/spells/shield-of-faith/) and your choice of [*protection from chaos*](/spells/protection-from-chaos/), [*evil*](/spells/protection-from-evil/), [*good*](/spells/protection-from-good/), or [*law*](/spells/protection-from-law/). As a move action, the target can transfer this spell to a touched ally, who becomes the new target of the spell.

The alignment descriptor of this spell matches the alignment descriptor of the *protection* spell you chose when casting it. For example, granting the target *protection from evil* gives this spell the good descriptor.
