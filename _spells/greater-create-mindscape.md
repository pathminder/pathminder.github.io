This spell functions like [*create mindscape*](/spells/create-mindscape/), except it can affect more creatures, the mindscape lasts longer, and you can choose the mindscape's magic trait. You can also direct a number of believable creatures at a time equal to your caster level.

*Greater create mindscape* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell by a caster of 15th level or higher at a cost of 17,500 gp. You and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the [*mindscape door*](/spells/mindscape-door/) spell.
