If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an [Escape Artist](/skills/escape-artist/) check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the [Escape Artist](/skills/escape-artist/) skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a hold person spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).
