Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. This bonus doesn't apply to other uses of the [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.
