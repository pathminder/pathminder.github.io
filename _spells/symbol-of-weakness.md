This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that every creature within 60 feet of a *symbol of weakness* instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.

Unlike symbol of death, *symbol of weakness* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of weakness* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.

*Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of weakness* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for *symbol of weakness*.
