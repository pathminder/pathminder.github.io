This spell creates a subtle and complicated force effect that is most effective when used by a still or slow-moving spellcaster or formula user. While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move more than 5 feet with a single move action. If the action that discharges the spell also provokes attacks of opportunity, that action still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
