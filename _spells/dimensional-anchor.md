A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a *dimensional anchor* include [*astral projection*](/spells/astral-projection/), [*blink*](/spells/blink/), [*dimension door*](/spells/dimension-door/), [*ethereal jaunt*](/spells/ethereal-jaunt/), [*etherealness*](/spells/etherealness/), [*gate*](/spells/gate/), [*maze*](/spells/maze/), [*plane shift*](/spells/plane-shift/), [*shadow walk*](/spells/shadow-walk/), [*teleport*](/spells/teleport/), and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a [*gate*](/spells/gate/) or [*teleportation circle*](/spells/teleportation-circle/) for the duration of the spell.

A *dimensional anchor* does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, *dimensional anchor* does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
