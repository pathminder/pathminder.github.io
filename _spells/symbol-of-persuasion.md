This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that all creatures within the radius of a *symbol of persuasion* instead become charmed by the caster (as the [*charm monster*](/spells/charm-monster/) spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of persuasion* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of persuasion* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of persuasion* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for *symbol of persuasion*.
