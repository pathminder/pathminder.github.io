You alter the target's mood, adjusting its attitude toward you or another creature you designate by one step either positively or negatively (see the [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) skill). You can instead use this spell to assist your own or an ally's [Bluff](/skills/bluff/), [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/), [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/), [Perform](/skills/perform/), or [Sense Motive](/skills/sense-motive/) check, granting that check a +5 insight bonus against the target of your *telempathic projection* with no save. In this case, the spell's duration expires immediately when the skill check is complete.
