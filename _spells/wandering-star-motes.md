You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the *wandering star motes* jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the *wandering star motes* jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet. A given creature can only be affected by the *wandering star motes* once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.
