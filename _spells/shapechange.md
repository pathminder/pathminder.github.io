This spell allows you to take the form of a wide variety of creatures. This spell can function as [*alter self*](/spells/alter-self/), [*beast shape IV*](/spells/beast-shape-iv/), [*elemental body IV*](/spells/elemental-body-iv/), [*form of the dragon III*](/spells/form-of-the-dragon-iii/), [*giant form II*](/spells/giant-form-ii/), and [*plant shape III*](/spells/plant-shape-iii/) depending on what form you take. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.
