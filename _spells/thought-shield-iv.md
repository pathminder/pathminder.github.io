This functions as [*thought shield III*](/spells/thought-shield-iii), but any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, if you succeed at your save against a [*psychic crush*](/spells/psychic-crush/) spell, you take no damage. This spell can be undercast.
