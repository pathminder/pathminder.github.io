The target creature dies if it fails a Fortitude saving throw and its Hit Dice are no more than half your caster level.

If it dies, its corpse rapidly putrefies. The next creature to touch the corpse within 1 minute per level of the target's death causes the corpse to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half).
