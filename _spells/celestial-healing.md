You anoint a wounded creature with the blood of an outsider with the good subtype (such as an angel) or holy water, giving it fast healing 1. The target radiates the aura of a good creature for the duration of the spell and can sense the righteousness of the magic, though this has no long-term effect on the target's alignment. If the target has its own evil aura, this is not suppressed by celestial healing, and can also be detected normally.
