You weaken the target's defenses against poison. The target gains a --4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a --4 penalty.
