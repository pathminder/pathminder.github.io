With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until the end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/), [Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/), [Perception](/skills/perception/), [Sense Motive](/skills/sense-motive/), and [Survival](/skills/survival/) checks against them. If an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is shaken instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
