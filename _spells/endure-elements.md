A creature protected by *endure elements *suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between --50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected.

*Endure elements* doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.
