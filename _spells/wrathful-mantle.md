A shimmering mantle of light shrouds the subject, casting light like a torch. The subject of the spell gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The subject can end the *wrathful mantle* at any time as a swift action to deal 2d8 points of force damage to all creatures within 5 feet.
