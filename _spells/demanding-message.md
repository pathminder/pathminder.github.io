This spell initially functions as [*message*](/spells/message/) (allowing no save or spell resistance). Once during the message effect, you can concentrate as a standard action to issue a [*suggestion*](/spells/suggestion/) to one target as part of delivering a message. Spell resistance and a Will save apply to the *suggestion*, and it lasts for 1 hour per level or until completed.
