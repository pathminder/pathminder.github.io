You forbid the target a single course of action, which it avoids to the best of its ability. You may demand the target not take actions that fall into one of the following options.

- *Attack:* The target cannot take any action that involves an attack roll, or uses a spell or ability that targets a foe or an area that includes a foe.
- *Cast:* The target cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities.
- *Communicate:* The target cannot take any actions that allow it to communicate with anyone. This includes such acts as speaking, [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks to pass secret messages, writing, and using telepathy. It does not prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting.
- *Draw:* The target cannot ready or prepare any item, weapon, component, or equipment.
- *Move:* The target can take no act that would cause it to end up in a different location. The target does not resist being moved by others (and thus can be picked up or dragged, or can float along on a raft), but does not consciously attempt to move (including not directing a mount to move).

The target is free to take any actions not forbidden by the caster. For example, a target affected by this spell's demand to not move is still free to cast spells, make attacks, or shout for help.
