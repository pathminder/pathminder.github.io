You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less
than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with [*raise dead*](/spells/raise-dead/)). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast *raise dead* or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with *temporary resurrection*, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
