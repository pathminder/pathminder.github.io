## Contributing

Pull requests are great, but make sure anything you want to contribute is under the OGL.

1. Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/pathminder.github.io.git

2. Make your changes. For simple changes, this probably means just modifying a Markdown file. For more complicated changes, you'll want to have Ruby installed, so you can run `bundle install` and `jekyll serve` in the repo folder to view a copy of the site locally.

3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/pathminder/pathminder.github.io/compare/).

All contributions should have a linked source with an OGL notice, Section 15 entry, and any other legalities covered. We don't want to end up with "orphan" content that only exists on the Pathminder site or that has OGL status in doubt.
