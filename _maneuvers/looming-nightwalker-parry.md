You transform your body into shadowy energy, turning blows aside. When you initiate this boost, you gain negative energy resistance 20 and DR 15/silver and good until the beginning of your next turn.

**Grave Call:** An undead creature initiating this boost gains positive energy resistance 20 instead of negative energy resistance.
