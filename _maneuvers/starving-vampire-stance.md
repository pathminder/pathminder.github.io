When you assume this stance, you skin gains a deathly pallor, and your canines, if any, sharpen and elongate. While maintaining this stance, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, you gain twice that creature's Hit Dice in temporary hit points. The temporary hit points gained from this stance stack with those gained from other Unquiet Grave maneuvers, up to the normal maximum.
