You afflict your victim with an entropic curse, sealing their life force away from succor. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 2d8 points of negative energy damage, and your victim must succeed at a Will save or become cursed and unable to heal hit point damage (by any means) for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier.
