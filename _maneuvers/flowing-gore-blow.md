Your axe flows forth with negative energy, creating a cursed wound. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 4d8 points of bleed damage. The wound left behind is laced with negative energy; the caster of a healing spell or similar effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + initiator level) to halt the bleed damage (healing from the spell or effect still occurs even if the check fails to halt the bleeding), and the DC to apply first aid with the Heal skill increases by 5 + your initiation modifier.
