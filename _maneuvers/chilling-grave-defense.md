You afflict an attacker with the chill of the grave, sapping the strength from their limbs. You may acti- vate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you. The creature making that attack suffers a -4 penalty to its Strength and Dexterity for 1 round. Apply these penalties before calculating the attack and damage rolls for the attack (this may cause the attack to miss).
