You cleave into your foe with an executioner's strike. Make a melee attack. If it hits and your victim is at more than 1/4 their maximum hit point total, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 6d8 points of negative energy damage. If your victim is at 1/4 or less of their maximum hit point total, that creature instead dies (no save) and you gain temporary hit points equal to twice its Hit Dice. The temporary hit points gained from this maneuver stack with those gained from other Unquiet Grave maneuvers, to the normal maximum.
