Your weapon descends in a merciless swing, its cursed edge crawling into the wounds of your victims. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 3d6 Constitution damage and 9d8 bleed damage that ignores immunity to bleed. The wound left behind is laced with negative energy; the caster of a healing spell or similar effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + initiator level) to halt the bleed damage (healing from the spell or effect still occurs even if the check fails to halt the bleeding), and the DC to apply first aid with the Heal skill increases by 9 + your initiation modifier.

**Grave Call:** An undead creature initiating this maneuver gains temporary hit points equal to twice the Hit Dice of the creature struck. The temporary hit points gained from this maneuver stack with those gained from other Unquiet Grave maneuvers, to the normal maximum.
