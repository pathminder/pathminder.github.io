You afflict an attacker with the charnel stench of the ghast, ruining their blow. You may initiate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you. The creature attacking you becomes sickened for 1 round and must succeed at a Fortitude save or also become nauseated for 1 round. Apply these penalties before calculating the attack and damage rolls for the attack (this may cause the attack to miss or not occur).
