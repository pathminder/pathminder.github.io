You move with the swiftness and cunning of the cannibalistic ghouls. When you initiate this boost you gain a +4 competence bonus to Stealth checks for 1 round. During that time, you do not require cover or concealment to remain hidden using the Stealth skill, which may permit you to move in the open without being detected. You still suffer the usual effects of not having cover or concealment while using Stealth when the duration of this boost expires.
