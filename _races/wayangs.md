summary: The small wayangs are creatures of the Plane of Shadow. They are so attuned to shadow that it even shapes their philosophy, believing that upon death they merely merge back into darkness. The mysteries of their shadowy existence grant them the ability to gain healing from negative energy as well as positive energy.

The wayangs are a race of small supernatural humanoids who trace their ancestry to the Plane of Shadows. They are extremely gaunt, with pixielike stature and skin the color of deep shadow. Deeply spiritual, they follow a philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they may again merge into the shadow. They readily express their beliefs through ritual scarification and skin bleaching, marking their bodies with raised white dots in ornate spirals and geometric patterns. Shy and elusive, they live in small, interdependent tribes. Wayangs rarely associate with outsiders.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial trait may be selected instead of existing wayang racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting this new option.

**Dissolution's Child:** Once per day, you may change your appearance to look as if you were little more than a 4-foot-tall area of shadow. Your physical form still exists and you are not incorporeal---only your appearance changes. This works like [*invisibility*](spells/invisibility/), except it only lasts 1 round per level (maximum 5 rounds). This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.

## Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all wayangs who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Bard:** Add one spell known from the wizard's illusion school spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the bard can cast. The spell is treated as being one level higher, unless it is also on the bard spell list.

**Oracle:** Add one spell known from the wizard's illusion school spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the oracle can cast. That spell is treated as one level higher unless it is also on the oracle spell list.

**Sorcerer:** Add +1/2 point of damage to any illusion spells of the shadow subschool cast by the sorcerer.

**Summoner:** Add +1 skill rank to the summoner's eidolon.
