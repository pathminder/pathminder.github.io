summary: These shapeshifting, foxlike folk share a love of mischief, art, and the finer things in life. They can appear as a single human as well as their true form, that of a foxlike humanoid. Kitsune are quick-witted, nimble, and gregarious, and because of this, a fair number of them become adventurers.

Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess two forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, and their true form of an anthropomorphic fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits.

Quick-witted and nimble, kitsune make excellent bards and rogues. It is not uncommon for one to pursue sorcery, while those few born with white fur and pale eyes usually become oracles.

## Kitsune Racial Traits

- **+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, --2 Strength:** Kitsune are agile and companionable, but tend to be physically weak.
- **Medium:** Kitsune are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Kitsune:** Kitsune are humanoids with the kitsune and shapechanger subtypes.
- **Normal Speed:** Kitsune have a base speed of 30 feet.
- **Low-Light Vision (Ex):** Kitsune can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
- **Change Shape (Su):** A kitsune can assume the appearance of a specific single human form of the same sex. The kitsune always takes this specific form when she uses this ability. A kitsune in human form cannot use her bite attack, but gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear human. Changing shape is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as [*alter self*](/spells/alter-self/), except that the kitsune does not adjust her ability scores and can remain in this form indefinitely.
- **Agile (Ex):** Kitsune receive a +2 racial bonus on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) checks.
- **Kitsune Magic (Ex/Sp):** Kitsune add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against enchantment spells that they cast. Kitsune with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like ability: 3/day---[*dancing lights*](/spells/dancing-lights/) (caster level equals the kitsune's level).
- **Natural Weapons (Ex):** In her natural form, a kitsune has a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage.
- **Languages:** Kitsune begin play speaking Common and Sylvan. Kitsune with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, and Tengu.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing kitsune racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Fast Shifter (Su):** You were born with an innate talent for switching between your natural forms. Using your racial change shape ability is a move action instead of a standard action. This racial trait replaces kitsune magic.

**Gregarious (Ex):** Even among your own kind, your gift for making friends stands out. Whenever you successfully use [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) to win over an individual, that creature takes a --2 penalty to resist any of your Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. This racial trait replaces agile.

## Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all kitsune who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Bard:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks to lie and a +1/2 bonus on [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) checks to gather information.

**Druid:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) and [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks to change a creature's attitude.

**Oracle:** Reduce the penalty for not being proficient for one weapon by 1. When the nonproficiency penalty for a weapon becomes 0 because of this ability, the oracle is treated as having the appropriate Martial or Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat for that weapon.

**Rogue:** The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.

**Sorcerer:** Add +1/4 to the DC of enchantment spells.
