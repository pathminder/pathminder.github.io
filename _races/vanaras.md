Vanaras are intelligent, monkeylike humanoids that live in deep, warm forests and lush jungles. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite their fur, vanaras can grow lengthy hair on their head just as humans can, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter and weighs slightly less than a typical human.

## Vanara Racial Traits

- **Low-Light Vision:** A vanara can see twice as far as a human in dim light.
- **Nimble:** Vanaras have a +2 racial bonus on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) and [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing vanara racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Tree Stranger:** Some vanaras have spent their lives among humans in centers of learning instead of traditional treetop homes. These vanaras treat all [Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) skills as class skills, but lose their climb speed racial trait.

**Whitecape:** The rare whitecape vanara clans have more in common with savanna-dwelling baboons than the jungle-dwelling monkeys that most vanaras resemble. Their stooping build grants them a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip. These vanaras usually have a thick mane of hair on the head and shoulders (called a "cape") and shorter tails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.
