summary: Long ago, fetchlings were humans exiled to the Shadow Plane, but that plane's persistent umbra has transformed them into a race apart. These creatures have developed an ability to meld into the shadows and have a natural affinity for shadow magic. Fetchlings---who call themselves *kayal*---often serve as emissaries between the inhabitants of the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane.

Descended from humans trapped on the Shadow Plane, fetchlings are creatures of darkness and light intertwined. Generations of contact with that strange plane and its denizens have made fetchlings a race apart from humanity. While fetchlings acknowledge their origins, they exhibit little physical or cultural resemblance to their ancestors on the Material Plane, and are often insulted when compared to humans. Some members of the race also take offense at the name fetchling, as it was given to them by humans who saw them as little more than fetchers of rare materials from the Shadow Plane. Most fetchlings instead prefer to be called kayal, a word borrowed from Aklo that roughly translates to "shadow people" or "dusk dwellers."

Infused with the essence of the Shadow Plane and possessing human blood commingled with that of the Shadow Plane's natives, fetchlings have developed traits and abilities that complement their native plane's bleak and colorless terrain. Though most fetchlings treat the Shadow Plane as home, they often trade and deal with creatures of the Material Plane. Some fetchlings go so far as to create enclaves on the Material Plane in order to establish alliances and trade routes in areas where the boundary between the two planes is less distinct. These fetchlings often serve as merchants, middlemen, and guides for races on both sides of the planar boundary.

**Physical Description:** Superficially, fetchlings resemble unnaturally lithe---bordering on fragile---humans. Their adopted home has drained their skin and hair of bright colors. Their complexion ranges from stark white to deep black, and includes all the various shades of gray between those two extremes. Their eyes are pupilless and pronounced, and they typically glow a luminescent shade of yellow or greenish yellow, though rare individuals possess blue-green eyes. While their hair tends to be stark white or pale gray, many fetchlings dye their hair black. Some members of higher station or those who dwell on the Material Plane dye their hair with more striking colors, often favoring deep shades of violet, blue, and crimson.

**Society:** Fetchling are adaptable creatures, and as such display no singular preference for moral philosophy or the rule of law. Most mimic the cultural norms and governmental structures of those they live near or the creatures they serve. While fetchlings are arguably the most populous race on the Shadow Plane, they rarely rule over their own kind; most serve as vassals or subjects to the great umbral dragons of their homeland, or the bizarre nihiloi who dwell in the deeper darkness. Above all, fetchlings are survivors. Their tenacity, versatility, and devious pragmatism have helped them survive the harsh environs of the Shadow Plane and plots of the powerful creatures dwelling within it. On the Material Plane, especially if unable to return to their home plane at will, fetchlings tend to cluster in small, insular communities of their own kind, mimicking the cultural norms and political structures of those they trade with.

**Relations:** Because of their shared ancestry, fetchlings interact most easily with humans, though they also find kinship with gnomes and other races that were cut off from their home planes or are not native to the Material Plane. Their pragmatism and adaptable nature put them at odds with warlike or destructive races, and when they do have to deal with orcs, goblinoids, or other savage cultures, fetchlings will often play the part of the fawning sycophant, a tactic learned from serving umbral dragons and one they see as key to their race's survival. Strangely, their relationship with dwarves and elves are rather strained. Dwarves find fetchlings duplicitous and creepy, while the tension with elves is so subtle and inexplicable that both races find it difficult to explain.

**Alignment and Religion:** Fetchlings---especially those living outside the Shadow Plane---worship a wide variety of gods. A smaller number of evil fetchlings worship demon lords of darkness and lust.

**Adventurers:** The Shadow Plane's ever-present hazards pose great danger to fetchling adventurers, but also great opportunity. Because of their servile status on their home plane, however, most fetchlings prefer to adventure on the Material Plane, which often offers more freedom and trading opportunities between the two planes. Fetchlings make excellent ninjas, oracles, rangers, rogues, and summoners.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing fetchling racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Emissary:** Rare fetchlings excel in the role of emissary between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane. Once per day, such a fetchling can roll twice when making a [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) or [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check and take the better roll. This racial trait replaces shadow blending.

**Gloom Shimmer:** Some fetchlings can manipulate shadowy energy in order to displace their location instead of transporting between shadows. Upon reaching 9th level, instead of gaining [*shadow walk*](/spells/shadow-walk/) as a spell-like ability, these fetchlings gain [*displacement*](/spells/displacement/) as a spell-like ability usable twice per day. For this ability, a fetchling's caster level is equal to his total Hit Dice. This racial trait modifies the spell-like ability racial trait.

**Shadow Magic:** Fetchlings who spend their time studying the subtle magic of their adopted plane gain arcane insights on the use of shadow spells. These fetchlings gain a +1 racial bonus to the DC of any illusion (shadow) spells they cast. This racial trait replaces the skilled racial trait.

**Subtle Manipulator:** Rather than taking on the forms of others, some fetchling are adept at destroying the memories of other creatures. Instead of gaining [*disguise self*](/spells/disguise-self/) as a spell-like ability, such fetchlings can use [*memory lapse*](/spells/memory-lapse/) once per day as a spell-like ability. For this ability, a fetchling's caster level is equal to his total Hit Dice. This racial trait modifies the spell-like ability racial trait.

**World Walker:** Fetchlings who have spent most of their lives on the Material Plane can become more acclimated to their new environments. Instead of gaining a +2 racial bonus on [Knowledge (planes)](/skills/knowledge-planes/) checks, these fetchlings gain a +1 racial bonus on [Knowledge (nature)](/skills/knowledge-nature/) and [Knowledge (local)](/skills/knowledge-local/) checks. This racial trait modifies the skilled racial trait.

## Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all fetchlings who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Oracle:** Treat the oracle's level as +1/3 higher for the purposes of determining which of its racial spell-like abilities it can use.

**Ranger:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) and Survival checks made on the Plane of Shadow.

**Rogue:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) and Sleight of Hand checks made while in dim light or darkness.

**Sorcerer:** Add +1/2 to either cold or electricity resistance (maximum resistance 10 for either type).

**Summoner:** The summoner's eidolon gains resistance 1 against either cold or electricity. Each time the summoner selects this reward, he increases his eidolon's resistance to one of those energy types by 1 (maximum 10 for any one energy type).

**Wizard:** Add one spell from the wizard spell list to wizard's spellbook. The spell must be at or below the highest level he can cast and be of the illusion (shadow) subschool or have the darkness descriptor.
