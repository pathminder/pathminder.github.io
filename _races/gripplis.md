Gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and have mottled green-and-brown skin. Most gripplis are primitive hunter gatherers, living on large insects and fish found near their treetop homes, and are unconcerned about events outside their swamps. The rare grippli who leaves the safety of the swamp tends to be a ranger or alchemist seeking to trade for metals and gems.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing grippli racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Glider:** Gripplis' aerodynamic bodies and thick webbing between the toes enable a falling grippli to treat the distance fallen as half the actual distance. The grippli can steer himself while falling, moving horizontally up to a number of feet equal to half the vertical distance fallen. The grippli cannot use this trait if it is wearing heavy armor, is carrying a heavy load, or is unable to react to the fall (such as being helpless). This racial trait replaces swamp stride.

**Jumper:** Gripplis with this trait are always considered to have a running start when making [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) checks to jump. This racial trait replaces camouflage.

**Princely:** The grippli gains proficiency with rapiers and a +2 racial bonus on [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) and [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks. This racial trait replaces swamp stride and weapon familiarity.

**Toxic Skin (Ex):** Once per day as a swift action, a grippli can create a poison that can be applied to a weapon or delivered as a touch attack. Alternatively, the grippli can smear the poison on its own body as a standard action, affecting the first creature to hit it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. The poison loses its potency after 1 hour. The grippli is immune to its own poison. This racial trait replaces swamp stride and camouflage.

*Grippli Poison:* Skin or weapon---contact or injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the grippli's Hit Dice plus its Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.

## Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all gripplis who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Alchemist:** Add +1/4 to the number of toxic skin uses per day.

**Druid:** Add a +1/2 bonus on concentration checks. This bonus doubles in a forest or swamp terrain.

**Gunslinger:** Add a +1/4 bonus on attack rolls when making a utility shot or a dead shot.

**Rogue:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks while in a forest or swamp.

**Ranger:** Add a +1 racial bonus on [Swim](/skills/swim/) skill checks. When this bonus reaches +8, the ranger gains a swim speed of 15 feet (this does not grant the ranger another +8 racial bonus on [Swim](/skills/swim/) checks).
