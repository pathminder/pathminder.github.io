The Universal Truth speaks to the bushi, allowing him to detect falsehood wherever it may hide. The bushi can use *discern lies* as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his initiator level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his initiation modifier, although these rounds need not be consecutive.
