An opponent that is dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability is affected by a targeted *dispel magic* affecting the lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have the major magic rogue talent to select this advanced talent.
