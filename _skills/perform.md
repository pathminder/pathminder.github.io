You are skilled at one form of entertainment, from singing to acting to playing an instrument. Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks.

Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small sample of which is provided for each category below.

- Act (comedy, drama, pantomime)
- Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
- Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
- Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
- Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
- Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
- String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
- Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, trumpet)
- Sing (ballad, chant, melody)

| Perform task       | Requires |  Time  |     Retry     |     DC     |
|:-------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Entertain audience |   ---    | Varies | Yes, at +2 DC | 10 or more |

**Entertain Audience:** You can impress audiences with your talent and skill in your chosen performance type. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)

| Performance               | DC |
|:--------------------------|:--:|
| Routine performance       | 10 |
| Enjoyable performance     | 15 |
| Great performance         | 20 |
| Memorable performance     | 25 |
| Extraordinary performance | 30 |

*Routine Performance:* This is akin to begging. You can earn 1d10 cp/day.

*Enjoyable Performance:* In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.

*Great Performance:* In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.

*Memorable Performance:* In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.

*Extraordinary Performance:* In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.

## Skill Unlocks

If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks. Each Perform skill gains access to skill unlocks separately.

**5 Ranks:** Whenever you attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Intimidate check, you can attempt a DC 20 Perform check to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

**10 Ranks:** Whenever you cast a spell with the emotion or language-dependent descriptor, you can attempt a DC 25 Perform check to increase the save DC by 1.

**15 Ranks:** Whenever you cast a spell with the emotion or language-dependent descriptor, you can attempt a DC 30 Perform check to increase your caster level by 1. You must choose whether to use this ability or the ability unlocked at 10 ranks when casting the spell.

**20 Ranks:** Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate. When you attempt a skill check with that skill, you can also attempt a Perform check and use the better result to determine the success of that skill check.
