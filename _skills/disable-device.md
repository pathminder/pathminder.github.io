If you're trained in this skill, you are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.

| Disable Device task  | Requires |      Time       | Retry |     DC     |
|:---------------------|:--------:|:---------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Disarm or rig device |   ---    | 1 round or more |  Yes  | 10 or more |
| Open lock            |   ---    |     1 round     |  Yes  | 20 or more |

**Disarm or Rig Device:** When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded.

The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

To disarm a magic trap, you must have the trapfinding ability.

| Task                        |    Time    |        DC        | Example                                                           |
|:----------------------------|:----------:|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple                      |  1 round   |        10        | Jam a lock                                                        |
| Tricky                      | 1d4 rounds |        15        | Sabotage a wagon wheel                                            |
| Difficult                   | 2d4 rounds |        20        | Disarm a trap, reset a trap                                       |
| Extreme                     | 2d4 rounds |        25        | Disarm a complex trap, cleverly sabotage a clockwork device       |
| Magic trap                  | 2d4 rounds | 25 + spell level | *Fire trap*, *glyph of warding*, *symbol*, *teleportation circle* |
| Leave no trace of tampering |    ---     |        +5        | ---                                                               |

**Open Lock:** As a full-round action, you can attempt to open a lock. The DC for opening a lock depends on its quality. If you do not have a set of thieves' tools, these DCs increase by 10.

| Lock Quality | DC |
|:-------------|:--:|
| Simple       | 20 |
| Average      | 25 |
| Good         | 30 |
| Superior     | 40 |

## Skill Unlocks

If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks.

**5 Ranks:** Reduce the time required to disarm a trap or open a lock by taking a --5 penalty on your Disable Device check for each step by which you reduce the time required: 2d4 rounds, 1d4 rounds, 1 round, a standard action, a move action, a swift action.

**10 Ranks:** You can disarm magical traps at a --10 penalty even if you lack the trapfinding ability. If you possess the trapfinding ability, when attempting to disable magic traps, you never trigger them, even if you perform the trigger action (such as looking at a *symbol*). If you fail the check, you can still trigger the trap, and you can't use this ability to bypass it.

**15 Ranks:** When attacked by a trap, you can attempt a Disable Device check as an immediate action (adding your trap sense bonus, if any) opposed by the trap's attack roll or its save DC. If you succeed, you take half damage (or no damage if you exceed the DC by at least 10).

**20 Ranks:** You halve the penalties for performing a quick disarm as described in the 5 Ranks entry. If you possess the trapfinding ability and accept a --20 penalty while using the ability unlocked at 15 ranks, all nearby allies gain the benefit, and you disable the trap as an immediate action before it can trigger if you exceed the DC by at least 10.
