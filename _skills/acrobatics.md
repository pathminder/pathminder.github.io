Using Acrobatics, you can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also dive, flip, jump, and roll to avoid attacks and overcome obstacles. An Acrobatics check is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation. It doesn't require an action.

If you have 3 or more ranks in Acrobatics, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2, and a +6 dodge bonus to AC when taking the total defense action instead of the usual +4.

Many conditions can affect your chances of success with Acrobatics checks. The following modifiers to target DCs apply to all Acrobatics skill checks. The modifiers stack with one another, but only the most severe modifier for any one condition applies.

| Acrobatics conditions                                                    | DC Modifier |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
| Slightly obstructed (gravel, sand)                                       |     +2      |
| Severely obstructed (cavern, rubble)                                     |     +5      |
| Slightly slippery (wet)                                                  |     +2      |
| Severely slippery (icy)                                                  |     +5      |
| Slightly sloped (<45°)                                                   |     +2      |
| Severely sloped (>45°)                                                   |     +5      |
| Slightly unsteady (boat in rough water)                                  |     +2      |
| Moderately unsteady (boat in a storm)                                    |     +5      |
| Severely unsteady (earthquake)                                           |     +10     |
| Move at full speed on narrow or uneven surfaces (doesn't apply to jumps) |     +5      |

**Balance:** You can use Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces---only one check is needed per round. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is then modified by the Acrobatics skill modifiers above.

| Surface Width            | Base Acrobatics DC |
|:-------------------------|:------------------:|
| Greater than 3 feet wide |         0          |
| 1--3 feet wide           |         5          |
| 7--11 inches wide        |         10         |
| 2--6 inches wide         |         15         |
| Less than 2 inches wide  |         20         |

No Acrobatics check is needed to move across surfaces 3 feet wide or narrower unless the modifiers to the surface increase the DC to 10 or higher.

While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you are considered flat-footed and lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC (if any). If you take damage while using Acrobatics in this way, you must immediately make another Acrobatics check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

**Move Through Threatened Square:** You can move through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy by using Acrobatics. The DC increases by 2 for each additional opponent avoided in 1 round. When moving in this way, you move at half speed. You can move at full speed by increasing the DC of the check by 10.

| Situation                      | Base Acrobatics DC |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------:|
| Move through a threatened area |   opponent's CMD   |
| Move through an enemy's space  | 5 + opponent's CMD |

You cannot use Acrobatics to move past foes if your speed is reduced due to carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor. If an ability allows you to move at full speed under such conditions, you can use Acrobatics to move past foes.

You can use Acrobatics in this way while prone, but doing so requires a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC is increased by 5.

If you attempt to move through an enemy's space and fail the check, you lose the move action and provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Jump:** You can jump as part of your movement. Distance moved by jumping counts as part of your movement for the turn.

You get a +4 racial bonus for every 10 feet of speed you have above 30 feet, and a --4 racial penalty for every 10 feet of speed you have below 30 feet.

The given text assumes that you have a running start. If you don't, halve your check result.

The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from.

*Long Jump:* Your check result is the horizontal distance you cross. If this isn't far enough but it puts you within 4 feet or closer of the length you're trying to jump, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold. If you can't reach, you fall.

*High Jump:* Your check result divided by four is the height you reach. If this isn't far enough but it this puts you within 1 foot or closer of the height you're trying to jump, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold. If you can't reach, you land prone.

**Soften Fall:** When you deliberately fall any distance, even as a result of a missed jump, a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall. See the falling rules for further details.

## Skill Unlocks

If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks.

**5 Ranks:** You can move at normal speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity by increasing the DC of the check by 5 (instead of by 10). You aren't denied your Dexterity bonus when attempting Acrobatics checks with DCs of 20 or lower.

**10 Ranks:** You can attempt an Acrobatics check at a --10 penalty and use the result as your CMD against trip maneuvers. You can also attempt an Acrobatics check at a --10 penalty in place of a Reflex save to avoid falling. You must choose to use this ability before the trip attempt or Reflex save is rolled. With a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check, you treat an unintentional fall as 10 feet shorter plus 10 feet for every 10 by which you exceed the DC, and treat an intentional fall as 10 feet shorter for every 10 by which you exceed the DC.

**15 Ranks:** You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when standing up from prone.

**20 Ranks:** You double the result of any Acrobatics check when jumping and never fall prone at the end of a fall as long as you remain conscious.
