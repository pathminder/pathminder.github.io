You can use this skill to identify martial maneuvers as soon as they are initiated, or recall tactics used in historic battles, as well as identifying warriors or generals in those battles or identifying heroes or villains in history and modern times. Using Knowledge (martial) doesn't require an action.

The DCs for Knowledge (martial) checks relating to various tasks are summarized below.

| Knowledge (martial) tasks |                Retry                 |          DC          |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Identify maneuver         |                  No                  | 10 + maneuver level  |
| Determine disciplines     | If the subject uses another maneuver | 20 + initiator level |
| Recall battle             |                  No                  |      15 or more      |
| Recall disciples          |                  No                  |          20          |

**Identify Manuever:** Identifying a maneuver as it is being initiated requires no action, but you must be able to clearly see or sense the maneuver as it is being initiated, and this incurs the same penalties as a Perception skill check due to distance, poor conditions, and other factors.

**Determine Disciplines:** You can determine all the disciplines known by a particular creature by watching it initiate at least one maneuver.

**Recall Battle:** You can recall important facts about historic battles and tactics used. The DC increases by 2 for each 50 years ago the battle occurred.

**Recall Disciples:** You can recall facts about prominent martial disciples in the region.
