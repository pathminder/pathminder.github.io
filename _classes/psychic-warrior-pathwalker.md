      A pathwalker begins his career with knowledge of three martial maneuvers. The pathwalker knows the Sleeping Goddess discipline and may select any two additional disciplines from the following list: Broken Blade, Iron Tortoise, Mithral Current, Piercing Thunder, Primal Fury, Scarlet Throne, Solar Wind, Tempest Gale, and Thrashing Dragon. The pathwalker's known disciplines will determine which warrior paths he may select as he makes his journey to martial perfection, selecting one to be his primary path and the second discipline path as his secondary at the appropriate level. He also gains the skill associated to that discipline as a class skill. Once he knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by a pathwalker is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. His maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he does not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one. He learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown above. The pathwalker must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it.

      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered psychic warrior level after that, he can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, the pathwalker loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. The pathwalker need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes his restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows. The pathwalker can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. A pathwalker's primary initiator attribute is Wisdom, and each pathwalker level is counted as a full initiator level.

      *Maneuvers Readied:* A pathwalker can ready all three of his three starting maneuvers, but as he advances in level and learns more maneuvers, he must choose which maneuvers to ready. He readies his maneuvers by meditating or performing weapon drills for 10 minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to repeat this again and change them. Pathwalkers do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in meditation, he can change his readied maneuvers. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the pathwalker initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below).

      Pathwalkers may recover their maneuvers in one of two ways. The pathwalker may concentrate on nature of his martial path as a swift action as part of an attack or full attack to recover one expended maneuver. Alternately, he may flood his psychic being with martial knowledge by expending his psionic focus to recover a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum of two) as a full round action. As part of this recovery action using this method, the pathwalker may manifest a single psychic warrior power known with a range of personal and a level up to 1/2 the maximum power level that he can manifest (rounded down), at his full manifester level without expending power points. The character cannot manifest powers with a manifesting time greater than 1 standard action or a duration of instantaneous in this way. Powers with a duration greater than instant have their durations shortened as well, equaling 1 + the pathwalker's Wisdom modifier in rounds (unless the duration would be shorter manifested normally).

      *Stances Known:* Pathwalkers begin play with knowledge of one 1st level stance from any discipline open to them. At the indicated levels (see class table), the pathwalker selects an additional new stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended and he does not have to ready them. All the stances he knows are available to him at all times, and he can change the stance he is currently using as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, the pathwalker cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one he already knows.

      A psychic warrior's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 2-4: The Psychic Warrior. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.

      *Powers Known:* A psychic warrior begins play knowing one psychic warrior power of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of a new power.

      Choose the powers known from the psychic warrior power list. (Exception: The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a psychic warrior to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A psychic warrior can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.

      The total number of powers a psychic warrior can manifest in a day is limited only by his daily power points.

      A psychic warrior simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.

      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psychic warrior powers is 10 + the power's level + the psychic warrior's Wisdom modifier.

      *Maximum Power Level Known:* A psychic warrior begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability to master more complex powers.

      To learn or manifest a power, a psychic warrior must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

      At 1st level, a psychic warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The psychic warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 5th level, at 8th level, at 14th level, and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th, etc.). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as combat feats or psionic feats. The psychic warrior must still meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums as well as class requirements (like levels in another specific class).

      These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every two levels. A psychic warrior is not limited to combat feats and psionic feats when choosing these other feats.

      At 1st level, a psychic warrior chooses a path to adhere to (listed below). When first taking a path, the psychic warrior gains one of the two powers associated with that path. Powers gained from a path do not count against his number of powers known. When manifesting this power, called a path power, the psychic warrior can either choose to manifest it for no cost by expending his psionic focus, in which case it cannot be augmented, or he can choose to manifest it normally, in which case his effective manifester level for this power is treated as one higher than normal.

      In addition, the psychic warrior gains one additional class skill, as noted in the path description.

      At 3rd level, the psychic warrior gains the second power from his path. All of the above benefits apply to this additional path power.

      **Broken Blade Path:** Psychic warriors that value the strength of body as well as the strength of the mind gravitate toward the path of the Broken Blade.

This attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This bonus to his CMB increases by 1 for every five psychic warrior levels possessed.

      **Mithral Current Path:** The lightning-fast Mithral Current pathwalkers strike with the power and force of a hurricane wind, move with the fluidity of a raging river, and are as cunning as fox. They carefully time their blows with their draw-and- strike techniques, and remain ever-ready to draw their blade and test their steel.

      **Scarlet Throne Path:**  Pathwalkers who walked the blood-drenched road that leads to the Scarlet Throne are often haughty, proud, arrogant warriors.

This bonus increases by +1 at 7th level and every four levels thereafter.

      *Maneuver:* Starting at 3rd level, the pathwalker can expend his psionic focus as a swift action to create a field of defensive psychic force through his skin and body, increasing the pathwalker's natural armor bonus by +2. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the pathwalker's class level, and increases by +1 at 8th level and every five levels thereafter

      **Solar Wind Path:** Perceptive and keen of mind, Solar Wind adherents are often watchful and wary of danger.

      At 3rd level, the psychic warrior expands his understanding of his chosen path. From this point on, he can use the trance and maneuver associated with his chosen path.

      Unless otherwise indicated, if the psychic warrior expends psionic focus to activate a maneuver, he still gain the benefit of his trance until the end of his turn.

  - name: path skill
    levels: [4, 10, 16, 19]
    text: At 4th level, the psychic warrior gains a +2 bonus to one skill associated with a path he is on. At 10th level, 16th level, and every three levels thereafter, he can choose to increase the bonus to one of his path skills by +2 (to a maximum of +6 for any one path skill). This may be a skill he has already chosen or a new skill associated with a path he is on.

  - name: martial power
    levels: [6]
    text: At 6th level, if the psychic warrior makes an attack (but not a ranged touch attack), he can manifest one of his path powers as part of that attack action. The power takes effect immediately after the attack has been finished. Touch range powers are transmitted through the melee attack to the attacked target. The psychic warrior gaing the benefits of the power on the attack made, even if the power is what grants the weapon to make the attack. The psychic warrior may only activate a path power in this fashion once per round.

      At 11th level, the psychic warrior can choose to use the trance and maneuver from his second warrior's path, but may only benefit from one trance at a time.

      The psychic warrior treats the path skills of his secondary path as class skills and may select them when choosing a path skill.

  - name: twisting path

    levels: [12]
    text: At 12th level, as a swift action while maintaining psionic focus and using a trance, the psychic warrior can change to the trance of his other path.

    type: Su
    levels: [20]
    text: At 20th level, once per day as a free action, the psychic warrior can enter into a very powerful trance. As long as he maintains psionic focus, for up to 5 minutes the psychic warrior adds his Wisdom modifier to his attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, skill checks, ability checks, saves, and initiative, and he increases his speed by +5 feet for every point of his Wisdom modifier. These benefits stack with those that might be granted by his active path's trance.

Where the psion spends his days studying the intricacies of psionic power and unlocking the mysteries of the mind, others choose to use their internal power to augment their physical form. These psychic warriors use their psionic potential as a way to improve their natural abilities, becoming fierce and deadly in their chosen path.

The psychic warrior is a force to be reckoned with, a talented combatant with skill in both the realm of battle and the mind. Some psychic warriors focus more strongly on their martial talents, and they discover that the martial disciplines along the Path of War are capable of strong philosophical insights. These insights lead to additional warrior paths for the psychic warrior to travel, and they are known as pathwalkers.

**Role:** The psychic warrior's path determines his strengths and weaknesses within a party. Whether he is the epitome of unleashing the beast within, or a stealthy combatant who strikes from the shadows, the psychic warrior's primary focus is typically battlefield control and dealing or blocking damage.
