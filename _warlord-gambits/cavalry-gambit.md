**Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful mounted charge attack or mounted overrun maneuver against a target creature.

**Reward:** The warlord's opponent's defense is unbalanced; the warlord and his allies gain a morale bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on attacks of opportunity against that foe until the warlord's next turn.
