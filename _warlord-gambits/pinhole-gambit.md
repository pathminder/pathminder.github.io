**Risk:** The warlord attempts to successfully use a ranged attack against an opponent engaged in melee with an ally.

**Reward:** The successful and surprising attack against the foe shakes the enemy's confidence and harms its ability to defend itself; the warlord's Charisma modifier is applied as a penalty to its Armor Class until the warlord's next turn.
