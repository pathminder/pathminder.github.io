**Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful dirty trick maneuver against an opponent.

**Reward:** The warlord and his allies are filled with malicious glee to attack the warlord's foe, and gain his Charisma modifier as a morale bonus to damage rolls to a single attack against this target until the warlord's next turn.
