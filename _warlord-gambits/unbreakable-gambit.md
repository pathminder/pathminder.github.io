**Risk:** The warlord attempts to succeed on a Fortitude or Will save against an extraordinary ability, maneuver, power, spell, or spell-like or supernatural ability. The effect in question must not be a harmless effect on a failed saving throw. Unlike other gambits, this one can be attempted as an immediate action instead of a swift action.

**Reward:** The warlord is emboldened by his ability to resist his opponent's attack, and regains a number of hit points equal to three times his Charisma modifier.
