**Risk:** The warlord attempts to make a successful charge attack against an opponent (if the character has the ability to make multiple attacks at the end of a charge, the initial first attack must be successful for this gambit's success).

**Reward:** The warlord's actions embolden his allies and sets his spirit alight with courage; the warlord and his allies gain a morale bonus to damage equal to the warlord's Charisma modifier on the next attack they make or until the warlord's next turn.
