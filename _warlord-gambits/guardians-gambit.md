The vanguard commander gains this gambit automatically at 1st level.

**Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful charging shield bash attack against an opponent.

**Reward:** If the shield bash attempt is successful, the warlord and all allies within 30 ft. may make a free 5 ft. step, even if they have already made one this turn.
