**Risk:** The warlord successfully reduces an opponent to 0 or few hit points with a melee or ranged attack on his turn from either a standard attack or full attack action.

**Reward:** The warlord and his allies gain a morale bonus on attack rolls equal to his Charisma modifier on their next attack roll.
