**Risk:** The warlord attempts a steal combat maneuver against an opponent.

**Reward:** By successfully stealing an opponent's item, the warlord infuriates them to the point of heedless anger. That opponent takes a penalty to their AC equal to the warlord's initiation modifier, but gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls against the warlord. Both the penalty and bonus last until the start of the warlord's next turn.
