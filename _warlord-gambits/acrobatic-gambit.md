**Risk:** The warlord attempts an Acrobatics check to move through an opponent's threatened area.

**Reward:** The warlord's brash move allows attacks against the opponent or opponents that the warlord evaded this round to inflict an additional 1d6 + his Charisma modifier points of damage upon a successful hit. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.
