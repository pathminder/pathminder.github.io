**Risk:** The warlord attempts to successfully use the disarm maneuver against an opponent.

**Reward:** The warlord's opponent is disarmed of a weapon and then the warlord may make an immediate attack of opportunity against his foe and gains a morale bonus to damage equal to his Charisma modifier if the attack is successful.
