While holding a dose of poison in her mouth, the barbarian can exhale a 15-foot cone of inhaled poison. Anyone caught in the spray must succeed at a saving throw against the poison with a DC equal to the poison's DC --4 or suffer the poison's effects with an immediate onset.

A barbarian must have [viper's kiss](/rage-powers/vipers-kiss/) to select this rage power.
