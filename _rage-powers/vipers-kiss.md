The barbarian can drink 1 dose of an ingested poison as a move action (instead of a standard action) as long as she starts the turn with the poison in her hand. She can hold this dose within her mouth for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) without suffering harmful effects. If the barbarian still holds the poison in her mouth after this time, she consumes the poison. While the dose is held within her mouth, the barbarian's next successful bite attack applies the effect of the poison with an immediate onset; this consumes the dose.

A barbarian must have a bite attack (at least when raging, such as that granted by animal fury) to select this rage power.
