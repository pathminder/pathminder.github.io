Your god's sacred duties are to protect the faithful, take lessons from the great craftsmen and strategists of the past, and prepare against dark times. You receive a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (engineering) and Knowledge (history) checks. One of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.
