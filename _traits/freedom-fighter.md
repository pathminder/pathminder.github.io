Your parents allowed escaping slaves to hide in your home, and the stories you've heard from them instilled into you a deep loathing of slavery. You gain a +1 trait bonus on any skill check or attack roll made during the process of escaping capture or in helping a slave escape bondage, and Escape Artist is always a class skill for you.
