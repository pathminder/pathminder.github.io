You gain a +1 trait bonus on Charisma checks against evil creatures. If you select the [Leadership](/feats/leadership/) feat or the [Vile Leadership](/feats/vile-leadership/) feat at any point when you meet the prerequisites for that feat, you can recruit a cohort who is up to 1 level lower than you (instead of the normal requirement that your cohort must be 2 or more levels lower than you are) as long as your cohort is evil.
